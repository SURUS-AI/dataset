0;1463530;Effect of enalapril on mortality and the development of heart failure in asymptomatic patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fractions.;"Background. It is not known whether the treatment of patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction reduces mortality and morbidity. We studied the effect of an angiotensin-converting--enzyme inhibitor, enalapril, on total mortality and mortality from cardiovascular causes, the development of heart failure, and hospitalization for heart failure among patients with ejection fractions of 0.35 or less who were not receiving drug treatment for heart failure. Methods. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either placebo (n = 2117) or enalapril (n = 2111) at doses of 2.5 to 20 mg per day in a double-blind trial. Follow-up averaged 37.4 months. Results. There were 334 deaths in the placebo group, as compared with 313 in the enalapril group (reduction in risk, 8 percent by the log-rank test; 95 percent confidence interval, -8 percent [an increase of 8 percent] to 21 percent; P = 0.30). The reduction in mortality from cardiovascular causes was larger but was not statistically significant (298 deaths in the placebo group vs. 265 in the enalapril group; risk reduction, 12 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, -3 to 26 percent; P = 0.12). When we combined patients in whom heart failure developed and those who died, the total number of deaths and cases of heart failure was lower in the enalapril group than in the placebo group (630 vs. 818; risk reduction, 29 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 21 to 36 percent; P less than 0.001). In addition, fewer patients given enalapril died or were hospitalized for heart failure (434 in the enalapril group; vs. 518 in the placebo group; risk reduction, 20 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 9 to 30 percent; P less than 0.001). Conclusions. The angiotensin-converting--enzyme inhibitor enalapril significantly reduced the incidence of heart failure and the rate of related hospitalizations, as compared with the rates in the group given placebo, among patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction. There was also a trend toward fewer deaths due to cardiovascular causes among the patients who received enalapril.";Circulatory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train
1;3345621;Effects of 1-epinephrine on hemodynamics and cardiac function in coronary disease: dose-response studies.;To assess the effects of elevated epinephrine levels on cardiovascular performance in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), epinephrine was infused intravenously into eight patients with normal coronary anatomy and 22 patients with CAD at dose rates of 0.06, 0.12, 0.18, and 0.24 micrograms/kg/min. Hemodynamic responses to epinephrine were not significantly different between the two groups. However, contractility increased significantly more (P less than 0.05) and end-systolic volume decreased significantly more (P less than 0.025) in normal subjects than in those with CAD. Plasma norepinephrine concentrations increased significantly (P less than 0.05) at 0.24 micrograms/kg/min epinephrine, indicating activation of sympathetic nervous system. Epinephrine ischemic thresholds ranged from 652 to 3362 pg/ml. Patients with CAD compared with normal subjects had more frequent ventricular arrhythmias (55% vs. 25%), chest pain (50% vs. 13%), and ischemic ECG changes (73% vs. 13%). These results indicate that although epinephrine induced myocardial ischemia in CAD, hemodynamics and ventricular pump function were maintained.;Circulatory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train
2;8598866;A randomized comparison of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy after the placement of coronary-artery stents.;"Background. The clinical benefit of coronary-artery stenting performed in conjunction with coronary angioplasty is limited by the risk of thrombotic occlusion of the stent as well as hemorrhagic and vascular complications of intensive anticoagulation. We compared antiplatelet therapy with conventional anticoagulant therapy with respect to clinical outcomes 30 days after coronary-artery stenting. Methods. After successful placement of Palmaz-Schatz coronary-artery stents, 257 patients were randomly assigned to receive antiplatelet therapy (ticlopidine plus aspirin) and 260 to receive anticoagulant therapy (intravenous heparin, phenprocoumon, and aspirin). The primary cardiac end point was a composite measure reflecting death from cardiac causes or the occurrence of myocardial infarction, aortocoronary bypass surgery, or repeat angioplasty. The primary noncardiac end point comprised death from noncardiac causes, cerebrovascular accident, severe hemorrhage, and peripheral vascular events. Results. Of the patients assigned to antiplatelet therapy, 1.6 percent reached a primary cardiac end point, as did 6.2 percent of those assigned to anticoagulant therapy (relative risk, 0.25; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.06 to 0.77). With antiplatelet therapy, there was an 82 percent lower risk of myocardial infarction than in the anticoagulant-therapy group, and a 78 percent lower need for repeat interventions. Occlusion of the stented vessel occurred in 0.8 percent of the antiplatelet-therapy group and in 5.4 percent of the anticoagulant-therapy group (relative risk, 0.14; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.02 to 0.62). A primary noncardiac end point was reached by 1.2 percent of the antiplatelet-therapy group and 12.3 percent of the anticoagulant-therapy group (relative risk, 0.09; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.02 to 0.31). Hemorrhagic complications occurred only in the anticoagulant-therapy group (in 6.5 percent). An 87 percent reduction in the risk of peripheral vascular events was observed with antiplatelet therapy. Conclusions. As compared with conventional anticoagulant therapy, combined antiplatelet therapy after the placement of coronary-artery stents reduces the incidence of both cardiac events and hemorrhagic and vascular complications.";Circulatory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Test
3;9892520;Results of the CAPRIE trial: efficacy and safety of clopidogrel. Clopidogrel versus aspirin in patients at risk of ischaemic events.;The recent CAPRIE trial (clopidogrel versus aspirin in patients at risk of ischaemic events) compared clopidogrel with aspirin in reducing the risk of vascular events in 19,185 patients with clinical manifestations of atherosclerosis. Participants were randomized to receive daily oral clopidogrel (75 mg) or aspirin (325 mg). Treatment periods ranged from 1 to 3 years. The primary outcome measurement was an aggregate of myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke and vascular death. Event rates of 5.32% and 5.83% were associated with clopidogrel and aspirin therapy, respectively. Clopidogrel therapy resulted in a relative risk reduction of 8.7% (CI 0.3-16.5%) compared with aspirin therapy (p = 0.043). Gastrointestinal hemorrhages occurred in 1.99% of patients treated with clopidogrel and 2.66% of patients treated with aspirin (p < 0.002). There were no significant treatment-based differences in the rates of intracerebral hemorrhages and hemorrhagic deaths or thrombocytopenia. These results indicate that clopidogrel is more effective and safer than aspirin in reducing adverse cardiovascular events in patients with atherosclerosis.;Circulatory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train
4;10023943;The Cardiac Insufficiency Bisoprolol Study II (CIBIS-II): a randomised trial.;Background. In patients with heart failure, beta-blockade has improved morbidity and left-ventricular function, but the impact on survival is uncertain. We investigated the efficacy of bisoprolol, a beta1 selective adrenoceptor blocker in decreasing all-cause mortality in chronic heart failure. Methods. In a multicentre double-blind randomised placebo-controlled trial in Europe, we enrolled 2647 symptomatic patients in New York Heart Association class III or IV, with left-ventricular ejection fraction of 35% or less receiving standard therapy with diuretics and inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme. We randomly assigned patients bisoprolol 1.25 mg (n=1327) or placebo (n=1320) daily, the drug being progressively increased to a maximum of 10 mg per day. Patients were followed up for a mean of 1.3 years. Analysis was by intention to treat. Findings. CIBIS-II was stopped early, after the second interim analysis, because bisoprolol showed a significant mortality benefit. All-cause mortality was significantly lower with bisoprolol than on placebo (156 [11.8%] vs 228 [17.3%] deaths with a hazard ratio of 0.66 (95% CI 0.54-0.81, p<0.0001). There were significantly fewer sudden deaths among patients on bisoprolol than in those on placebo (48 [3.6%] vs 83 [6.3%] deaths), with a hazard ratio of 0.56 (0.39-0.80, p=0.0011). Treatment effects were independent of the severity or cause of heart failure. Interpretation. Beta-blocker therapy had benefits for survival in stable heart-failure patients. Results should not, however, be extrapolated to patients with severe class IV symptoms and recent instability because safety and efficacy has not been established in these patients.;Circulatory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train
5;10379633;Efficacy and tolerability of moexipril and nitrendipine in postmenopausal women with hypertension. MADAM study group. Moexipril as Antihypertensive Drug After Menopause.;Objective. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and tolerability of the new angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor moexipril and the calcium antagonist nitrendipine in postmenopausal women with mild to moderate hypertension. Methods. After a 4-week placebo run-in period, 93 postmenopausal women (age range 44-70 years) with primary hypertension were randomized to receive moexipril 15 mg once daily or nitrendipine 20 mg once daily for 8 weeks. The mean sitting systolic (SSBP) and sitting diastolic blood pressures (SDBP) at baseline were 161.3/103.0 mmHg in the moexipril group, and 162.2/102.3 mmHg in the nitrendipine group. Results. After the 8 weeks of treatment, the SSBP/SDBP reductions were -21.2/-15.2 mmHg in the moexipril group and -18.2/-13.6 mmHg in the nitrendipine group. Blood pressure responses were adequate in 82.2% of the moexipril-treated patients and in 80.9% in the nitrendipine-treated group. Adverse events were more frequent with nitrendipine than with moexipril. The most common adverse events in the nitrendipine group were headache (23.4%), flushing (21.3%) and ankle oedema (14.9%). In the moexipril group the most common adverse event was cough (8.9%). Conclusion. The results of the study suggest that moexipril and nitrendipine are equieffective in the given dosages. In the patient population of postmenopausal women, the ACE inhibitor moexipril appears to have an advantage over the calcium antagonist nitrendipine with regard to tolerability.;Circulatory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train
6;10714728;Effects of controlled-release metoprolol on total mortality, hospitalizations, and well-being in patients with heart failure: the Metoprolol CR/XL Randomized Intervention Trial in congestive heart failure (MERIT-HF). MERIT-HF Study Group.;"Context. Results from recent studies on the effects of beta1-blockade in patients with heart failure demonstrated a 34% reduction in total mortality. However, the effect of beta1-blockade on the frequency of hospitalizations, symptoms, and quality of life in patients with heart failure has not been fully explored. Objective. To examine the effects of the beta1-blocker controlled-release/extended-release metoprolol succinate (metoprolol CR/XL) on mortality, hospitalization, symptoms, and quality of life in patients with heart failure. Design. Randomized, double-blind controlled trial, preceded by a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period, conducted from February 14, 1997, to October 31, 1998, with a mean follow-up of 1 year. Setting. Three hundred thirteen sites in 14 countries. Participants. Patients (n = 3991) with chronic heart failure, New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II to IV, and ejection fraction of 0.40 or less who were stabilized with optimum standard therapy. Interventions. Patients were randomized to metoprolol CR/XL, 25 mg once per day (NYHA class II), or 12.5 mg once per day (NYHA class III or IV), titrated for 6 to 8 weeks up to a target dosage of 200 mg once per day (n = 1990); or matching placebo (n = 2001). Main outcome measures. Total mortality or any hospitalization (time to first event), number of hospitalizations for worsening heart failure, and change in NYHA class, by intervention group; quality of life was assessed in a substudy of 741 patients. Results. The incidence of all predefined end points was lower in the metoprolol CR/XL group than in the placebo group, including total mortality or all-cause hospitalizations (the prespecified second primary end point; 641 vs 767 events; risk reduction, 19%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 10%-27%; P<.001); total mortality or hospitalizations due to worsening heart failure (311 vs 439 events; risk reduction, 31%; 95% CI, 20%-40%; P<.001), number of hospitalizations due to worsening heart failure (317 vs 451; P<.001); and number of days in hospital due to worsening heart failure (3401 vs 5303 days; P<.001). NYHA functional class, assessed by physicians, and McMaster Overall Treatment Evaluation score, assessed by patients, both improved in the metoprolol CR/XL group compared with the placebo group (P = .003 and P = .009, respectively). Conclusions. In this study of patients with symptomatic heartfailure, metoprolol CR/XL improved survival, reduced the need for hospitalizations due to worsening heart failure, improved NYHA functional class, and had beneficial effects on patient well-being.";Circulatory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train
7;11002953;The misoprostol third stage of labour study: a randomised controlled comparison between orally administered misoprostol and standard management.;"Objective. To compare misoprostol with standard oxytocic regimens in the prevention of postpartum haemorrhage. Design. Randomised controlled trial. Setting. Obstetric unit in a large teaching hospital. Methods. One thousand women randomised to 500 microg misoprostol given orally or to standard oxytocic regimens of oxytocin, oxytocin with ergometrine, or ergometrine. Main outcome measures. Incidence of postpartum haemorrhage and the incidence and severity of side effects. Results. Postpartum haemorrhage occurred in 12% of women given misoprostol and in 11% of women given standard oxytocic drugs (relative risk (RR) 1.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79, 1.55). Blood loss of 1000 mL or more occurred in 2% of women in each group. Nausea, headache, dizziness and tiredness were less frequent with misoprostol (RR (95% CI) 0.71 (0.59, 0.84); 0.53 (0.38, 0.74); 0.73 (0.61, 0.87) and 0.88 (0.83, 0.94) respectively). The main side effects of misoprostol were shivering (RR 1.95, 95% CI 1.69, 2.25) and a rise in temperature (difference in mean rise 0.34 degrees C, 95% CI 0.26, 0.42). Conclusion. Oral misoprostol for the prevention of postpartum haemorrhage was comparable to standard oxytocics. Many side effects were less common with misoprostol but shivering and pyrexia were more common. Larger randomised trials are needed before establishing the equivalence between misoprostol and standard oxytocic drugs in the prevention of postpartum haemorrhage.";Circulatory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train
8;11589932;Randomised trial of a perindopril-based blood-pressure-lowering regimen among 6,105 individuals with previous stroke or transient ischaemic attack.;Background. Blood pressure is a determinant of the risk of stroke among both hypertensive and non-hypertensive individuals with cerebrovascular disease. However, there is uncertainty about the efficacy and safety of blood-pressure-lowering treatments for many such patients. The perindopril protection against recurrent stroke study (PROGRESS) was designed to determine the effects of a blood-pressure-lowering regimen in hypertensive and non-hypertensive patients with a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack. Methods. 6105 individuals from 172 centres in Asia, Australasia, and Europe were randomly assigned active treatment (n=3051) or placebo (n=3054). Active treatment comprised a flexible regimen based on the angiotensin- converting-enzyme inhibitor perindopril (4 mg daily), with the addition of the diuretic indapamide at the discretion of treating physicians. The primary outcome was total stroke (fatal or non-fatal). Analysis was by intention to treat. Findings. Over 4 years of follow up, active treatment reduced blood pressure by 9/4 mm Hg. 307 (10%) individuals assigned active treatment suffered a stroke, compared with 420 (14%) assigned placebo (relative risk reduction 28% [95% CI 17-38], p<0.0001). Active treatment also reduced the risk of total major vascular events (26% [16-34]). There were similar reductions in the risk of stroke in hypertensive and non-hypertensive subgroups (all p<0.01). Combination therapy with perindopril plus indapamide reduced blood pressure by 12/5 mm Hg and stroke risk by 43% (30-54). Single-drug therapy reduced blood pressure by 5/3 mm Hg and produced no discernable reduction in the risk of stroke. Interpretation. This blood-pressure-lowering regimen reduced the risk of stroke among both hypertensive and non-hypertensive individuals with a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack. Combination therapy with perindopril and indapamide produced larger blood pressure reductions and larger risk reductions than did single drug therapy with perindopril alone. Treatment with these two agents should now be considered routinely for patients with a history of stroke or transient ischaemic attack, irrespective of their blood pressure.;Circulatory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train
9;12457784;Pravastatin in elderly individuals at risk of vascular disease (PROSPER): a randomised controlled trial.;"Background. Although statins reduce coronary and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality in middle-aged individuals, their efficacy and safety in elderly people is not fully established. Our aim was to test the benefits of pravastatin treatment in an elderly cohort of men and women with, or at high risk of developing, cardiovascular disease and stroke. Methods. We did a randomised controlled trial in which we assigned 5804 men (n=2804) and women (n=3000) aged 70-82 years with a history of, or risk factors for, vascular disease to pravastatin (40 mg per day; n=2891) or placebo (n=2913). Baseline cholesterol concentrations ranged from 4.0 mmol/L to 9.0 mmol/L. Follow-up was 3.2 years on average and our primary endpoint was a composite of coronary death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and fatal or non-fatal stroke. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. Findings. Pravastatin lowered LDL cholesterol concentrations by 34% and reduced the incidence of the primary endpoint to 408 events compared with 473 on placebo (hazard ratio 0.85, 95% CI 0.74-0.97, p=0.014). Coronary heart disease death and non-fatal myocardial infarction risk was also reduced (0.81, 0.69-0.94, p=0.006). Stroke risk was unaffected (1.03, 0.81-1.31, p=0.8), but the hazard ratio for transient ischaemic attack was 0.75 (0.55-1.00, p=0.051). New cancer diagnoses were more frequent on pravastatin than on placebo (1.25, 1.04-1.51, p=0.020). However, incorporation of this finding in a meta-analysis of all pravastatin and all statin trials showed no overall increase in risk. Mortality from coronary disease fell by 24% (p=0.043) in the pravastatin group. Pravastatin had no significant effect on cognitive function or disability. Interpretation. Pravastatin given for 3 years reduced the risk of coronary disease in elderly individuals. PROSPER therefore extends to elderly individuals the treatment strategy currently used in middle aged people.";Circulatory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Test
10;12479763;Major outcomes in high-risk hypertensive patients randomized to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or calcium channel blocker vs diuretic: The Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT).;"Context. Antihypertensive therapy is well established to reduce hypertension-related morbidity and mortality, but the optimal first-step therapy is unknown. Objective. To determine whether treatment with a calcium channel blocker or an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor lowers the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) or other cardiovascular disease (CVD) events vs treatment with a diuretic. Design. The Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT), a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled clinical trial conducted from February 1994 through March 2002. Setting and participants. A total of 33 357 participants aged 55 years or older with hypertension and at least 1 other CHD risk factor from 623 North American centers. Interventions. Participants were randomly assigned to receive chlorthalidone, 12.5 to 25 mg/d (n = 15 255); amlodipine, 2.5 to 10 mg/d (n = 9048); or lisinopril, 10 to 40 mg/d (n = 9054) for planned follow-up of approximately 4 to 8 years. Main outcome measures. The primary outcome was combined fatal CHD or nonfatal myocardial infarction, analyzed by intent-to-treat. Secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality, stroke, combined CHD (primary outcome, coronary revascularization, or angina with hospitalization), and combined CVD (combined CHD, stroke, treated angina without hospitalization, heart failure [HF], and peripheral arterial disease). Results. Mean follow-up was 4.9 years. The primary outcome occurred in 2956 participants, with no difference between treatments. Compared with chlorthalidone (6-year rate, 11.5%), the relative risks (RRs) were 0.98 (95% CI, 0.90-1.07) for amlodipine (6-year rate, 11.3%) and 0.99 (95% CI, 0.91-1.08) for lisinopril (6-year rate, 11.4%). Likewise, all-cause mortality did not differ between groups. Five-year systolic blood pressures were significantly higher in the amlodipine (0.8 mm Hg, P =.03) and lisinopril (2 mm Hg, P<.001) groups compared with chlorthalidone, and 5-year diastolic blood pressure was significantly lower with amlodipine (0.8 mm Hg, P<.001). For amlodipine vs chlorthalidone, secondary outcomes were similar except for a higher 6-year rate of HF with amlodipine (10.2% vs 7.7%; RR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.25-1.52). For lisinopril vs chlorthalidone, lisinopril had higher 6-year rates of combined CVD (33.3% vs 30.9%; RR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.05-1.16); stroke (6.3% vs 5.6%; RR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.02-1.30); and HF (8.7% vs 7.7%; RR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.07-1.31). Conclusion. Thiazide-type diuretics are superior in preventing 1 or more major forms of CVD and are less expensive. They should be preferred for first-step antihypertensive therapy.";Circulatory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train
11;12709465;Principal results of the Controlled Onset Verapamil Investigation of Cardiovascular End Points (CONVINCE) trial.;"Context Hypertensive patients are often given a calcium antagonist to reduce cardiovascular disease risk, but the benefit compared with other drug classes is controversial. Objective To determine whether initial therapy with controlled-onset extended-release (COER) verapamil is equivalent to a physician's choice of atenolol or hydrochlorothiazide in preventing cardiovascular disease. Design, setting, and participants Double-blind, randomized clinical trial conducted at 661 centers in 15 countries. A total of 16 602 participants diagnosed as having hypertension and who had 1 or more additional risk factors for cardiovascular disease were enrolled between September 1996 and December 1998 and followed up until December 31, 2000. After a mean of 3 years of follow-up, the sponsor closed the study before unblinding the results. Intervention Initially, 8241 participants received 180 mg of COER verapamil and 8361 received either 50 mg of atenolol or 12.5 mg of hydrochlorothiazide. Other drugs (eg, diuretic, beta-blocker, or an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) could be added in specified sequence if needed. Main outcome measures First occurrence of stroke, myocardial infarction, or cardiovascular disease-related death. Results Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were reduced by 13.6 mm Hg and 7.8 mm Hg for participants assigned to the COER verapamil group and by 13.5 and 7.1 mm Hg for partcipants assigned to the atenolol or hydrochlorothiazide group. There were 364 primary cardiovascular disease-related events that occurred in the COER verapamil group vs 365 in atenolol or hydrochlorothiazide group (hazard ratio [HR], 1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.88-1.18; P =.77). For fatal or nonfatal stroke, the HR was 1.15 (95% CI, 0.90-1.48); for fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction, 0.82 (95% CI, 0.65-1.03); and for cardiovascular disease-related death, 1.09 (95% CI, 0.87-1.37). The HR was 1.05 (95% CI, 0.95-1.16) for any prespecified cardiovascular disease-related event and 1.08 (95% CI, 0.93-1.26) for all-cause mortality. Nonstroke hemorrhage was more common with participants in the COER-verapamil group (n = 118) compared with the atenolol or hydrochlorothiazide group (n = 79) (HR, 1.54 [95% CI, 1.16-2.04]; P =.003). More cardiovascular disease-related events occurred between 6 AM and noon in both the COER verapamil (99/277) and atenolol or hydrochlorothiazide (88/274) groups; HR, 1.15 (95% CI, 0.86-1.53). Conclusions The CONVINCE trial did not demonstrate equivalence of a COER verapamil-based antihypertensive regimen compared with a regimen beginning with a diuretic or beta-blocker. When considered in the context of other trials of calcium antagonists, these data indicate that the effectiveness of calcium-channel therapy in reducing cardiovascular disease is similar but not better than diuretic or beta-blocker treatment.";Circulatory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train
12;12853587;Low-molecular-weight heparin versus a coumarin for the prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism in patients with cancer.;"Background. Patients with cancer have a substantial risk of recurrent thrombosis despite the use of oral anticoagulant therapy. We compared the efficacy of a low-molecular-weight heparin with that of an oral anticoagulant agent in preventing recurrent thrombosis in patients with cancer. Methods. Patients with cancer who had acute, symptomatic proximal deep-vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or both were randomly assigned to receive low-molecular-weight heparin (dalteparin) at a dose of 200 IU per kilogram of body weight subcutaneously once daily for five to seven days and a coumarin derivative for six months (target international normalized ratio, 2.5) or dalteparin alone for six months (200 IU per kilogram once daily for one month, followed by a daily dose of approximately 150 IU per kilogram for five months). Results. During the six-month study period, 27 of 336 patients in the dalteparin group had recurrent venous thromboembolism, as compared with 53 of 336 patients in the oral-anticoagulant group (hazard ratio, 0.48; P=0.002). The probability of recurrent thromboembolism at six months was 17 percent in the oral-anticoagulant group and 9 percent in the dalteparin group. No significant difference between the dalteparin group and the oral-anticoagulant group was detected in the rate of major bleeding (6 percent and 4 percent, respectively) or any bleeding (14 percent and 19 percent, respectively). The mortality rate at six months was 39 percent in the dalteparin group and 41 percent in the oral-anticoagulant group. Conclusions. In patients with cancer and acute venous thromboembolism, dalteparin was more effective than an oral anticoagulant in reducing the risk of recurrent thromboembolism without increasing the risk of bleeding.";Circulatory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train
13;13678872;Efficacy of perindopril in reduction of cardiovascular events among patients with stable coronary artery disease: randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial (the EUROPA study).;Background. Treatment with angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduces the rate of cardiovascular events among patients with left-ventricular dysfunction and those at high risk of such events. We assessed whether the ACE inhibitor perindopril reduced cardiovascular risk in a low-risk population with stable coronary heart disease and no apparent heart failure. Methods. We recruited patients from October, 1997, to June, 2000. 13655 patients were registered with previous myocardial infarction (64%), angiographic evidence of coronary artery disease (61%), coronary revascularisation (55%), or a positive stress test only (5%). After a run-in period of 4 weeks, in which all patients received perindopril, 12218 patients were randomly assigned perindopril 8 mg once daily (n=6110), or matching placebo (n=6108). The mean follow-up was 4.2 years, and the primary endpoint was cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or cardiac arrest. Analysis was by intention to treat. Findings. Mean age of patients was 60 years (SD 9), 85% were male, 92% were taking platelet inhibitors, 62% beta blockers, and 58% lipid-lowering therapy. 603 (10%) placebo and 488 (8%) perindopril patients experienced the primary endpoint, which yields a 20% relative risk reduction (95% CI 9-29, p=0.0003) with perindopril. These benefits were consistent in all predefined subgroups and secondary endpoints. Perindopril was well tolerated. Interpretation. Among patients with stable coronary heart disease without apparent heart failure, perindopril can significantly improve outcome. About 50 patients need to be treated for a period of 4 years to prevent one major cardiovascular event. Treatment with perindopril, on top of other preventive medications, should be considered in all patients with coronary heart disease.;Circulatory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train

Treatment lasted 12 weeks and was started with a titration period of variable length (dose range 300-900 mg tolperisone daily). The degree of spasticity determined on the Ashworth Scale in the most severely affected joint area was defined as primary target parameter. Hundred and twenty patients (43 females, 77 males) in a mean age of 63.3 +/- 10.6 years were recruited and received treatment. In the majority of patients both limbs of each side (right: n = 59; left: n = 56) were affected by the spasticity which on average had been present for 3.3 +/- 4.4 years. A 62% of the patients were treated with a daily dose >/=600 mg tolperisone. Tolperisone reduced the mean Ashworth Score by a mean of 1.03 +/- 0.71 compared with a mean reduction of 0.47 +/- 0.54 in the placebo group (P < 0.0001). A 78.3% of the patients on tolperisone versus 45% of the placebo patients experienced a reduction by at least 1 point on the Ashworth Scale (P < 0.0001). Functional and overall assessments of efficacy confirmed superior efficacy of tolperisone. Adverse events occurred less often on active treatment (n = 19) than on placebo (n = 26) and were mostly of mild-to-moderate intensity. No withdrawals caused by adverse events were reported in the tolperisone group. The findings of the present study demonstrate the efficacy and excellent tolerance of tolperisone in the treatment of spastic hypertonia following cerebral stroke. Study data further suggest that an individual dose titration which may exceed the recommended maximum dose of 450 mg daily results in optimized therapeutic benefit.";Circulatory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train
15;16143696;Effect on survival and hospitalization of initiating treatment for chronic heart failure with bisoprolol followed by enalapril, as compared with the opposite sequence: results of the randomized Cardiac Insufficiency Bisoprolol Study (CIBIS) III.;"Background. In patients with chronic heart failure (CHF), a beta-blocker is generally added to a regimen containing an angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. It is unknown whether beta-blockade as initial therapy may be as useful. Methods and results. We randomized 1010 patients with mild to moderate CHF and left ventricular ejection fraction < or =35%, who were not receiving ACE inhibitor, beta-blocker, or angiotensin receptor blocker therapy, to open-label monotherapy with either bisoprolol (target dose 10 mg QD; n=505) or enalapril (target dose 10 mg BID; n=505) for 6 months, followed by their combination for 6 to 24 months. The 2 strategies were blindly compared with regard to the combined primary end point of all-cause mortality or hospitalization and with regard to each of these end point components individually. Bisoprolol-first treatment was noninferior to enalapril-first treatment if the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the absolute between-group difference was <5%, corresponding to a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.17. In the intention-to-treat sample, the primary end point occurred in 178 patients allocated to bisoprolol-first treatment versus 186 allocated to enalapril-first treatment (absolute difference -1.6%, 95% CI -7.6 to 4.4%, HR 0.94; 95% CI 0.77 to 1.16). In the per-protocol sample, 163 patients allocated to bisoprolol-first treatment had a primary end point, versus 165 allocated to enalapril-first treatment (absolute difference -0.7%, 95% CI -6.6 to 5.1%, HR 0.97; 95% CI 0.78 to 1.21). With bisoprolol-first treatment, 65 patients died, versus 73 with enalapril-first treatment (HR 0.88; 95% CI 0.63 to 1.22), and 151 versus 157 patients were hospitalized (HR 0.95; 95% CI 0.76 to 1.19). Conclusions. Although noninferiority of bisoprolol-first versus enalapril-first treatment was not proven in the per-protocol analysis, our results indicate that it may be as safe and efficacious to initiate treatment for CHF with bisoprolol as with enalapril.";Circulatory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train
16;16154016;Prevention of cardiovascular events with an antihypertensive regimen of amlodipine adding perindopril as required versus atenolol adding bendroflumethiazide as required, in the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial-Blood Pressure Lowering Arm (ASCOT-BPLA): a multicentre randomised controlled trial.;"Background The apparent shortfall in prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD) noted in early hypertension trials has been attributed to disadvantages of the diuretics and beta blockers used. For a given reduction in blood pressure, some suggested that newer agents would confer advantages over diuretics and beta blockers. Our aim, therefore, was to compare the effect on non-fatal myocardial infarction and fatal CHD of combinations of atenolol with a thiazide versus amlodipine with perindopril. Methods We did a multicentre, prospective, randomised controlled trial in 19 257 patients with hypertension who were aged 40-79 years and had at least three other cardiovascular risk factors. Patients were assigned either amlodipine 5-10 mg adding perindopril 4-8 mg as required (amlodipine-based regimen; n=9639) or atenolol 50-100 mg adding bendroflumethiazide 1.25-2.5 mg and potassium as required (atenolol-based regimen; n=9618). Our primary endpoint was non-fatal myocardial infarction (including silent myocardial infarction) and fatal CHD. Analysis was by intention to treat. Findings The study was stopped prematurely after 5.5 years' median follow-up and accumulated in total 106 153 patient-years of observation. Though not significant, compared with the atenolol-based regimen, fewer individuals on the amlodipine-based regimen had a primary endpoint (429 vs 474; unadjusted HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.79-1.02, p=0.1052), fatal and non-fatal stroke (327 vs 422; 0.77, 0.66-0.89, p=0.0003), total cardiovascular events and procedures (1362 vs 1602; 0.84, 0.78-0.90, p<0.0001), and all-cause mortality (738 vs 820; 0.89, 0.81-0.99, p=0.025). The incidence of developing diabetes was less on the amlodipine-based regimen (567 vs 799; 0.70, 0.63-0.78, p<0.0001). Interpretation The amlodipine-based regimen prevented more major cardiovascular events and induced less diabetes than the atenolol-based regimen. On the basis of previous trial evidence, these effects might not be entirely explained by better control of blood pressure, and this issue is addressed in the accompanying article. Nevertheless, the results have implications with respect to optimum combinations of antihypertensive agents.";Circulatory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train
17;16714187;Aspirin plus dipyridamole versus aspirin alone after cerebral ischaemia of arterial origin (ESPRIT): randomised controlled trial.;"Background. Results of trials of aspirin and dipyridamole combined versus aspirin alone for the secondary prevention of vascular events after ischaemic stroke of presumed arterial origin are inconsistent. Our aim was to resolve this uncertainty. Methods. We did a randomised controlled trial in which we assigned patients to aspirin (30-325 mg daily) with (n=1363) or without (n=1376) dipyridamole (200 mg twice daily) within 6 months of a transient ischaemic attack or minor stroke of presumed arterial origin. Our primary outcome event was the composite of death from all vascular causes, non-fatal stroke, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or major bleeding complication, whichever happened first. Treatment was open, but auditing of outcome events was blinded. Primary analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial (number ISRCTN73824458) and with (NCT00161070). Findings. Mean follow-up was 3.5 years (SD 2.0). Median aspirin dose was 75 mg in both treatment groups (range 30-325); extended-release dipyridamole was used by 83% (n=1131) of patients on the combination regimen. Primary outcome events arose in 173 (13%) patients on aspirin and dipyridamole and in 216 (16%) on aspirin alone (hazard ratio 0.80, 95% CI 0.66-0.98; absolute risk reduction 1.0% per year, 95% CI 0.1-1.8). Addition of the ESPRIT data to the meta-analysis of previous trials resulted in an overall risk ratio for the composite of vascular death, stroke, or myocardial infarction of 0.82 (95% CI 0.74-0.91). Patients on aspirin and dipyridamole discontinued trial medication more often than those on aspirin alone (470 vs 184), mainly because of headache. Interpretation. The ESPRIT results, combined with the results of previous trials, provide sufficient evidence to prefer the combination regimen of aspirin plus dipyridamole over aspirin alone as antithrombotic therapy after cerebral ischaemia of arterial origin.";Circulatory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train
18;16730732;An isoflavone metabolite reduces arterial stiffness and blood pressure in overweight men and postmenopausal women.;"Objectives. Isoflavones reduce arterial stiffness, a predictor of cardiovascular events. Whether metabolites of isoflavones have similar bioactivity is unknown. The effect of supplemental trans-tetrahydrodaidzein (THD) a metabolite of daidzein on pulse wave velocity (PWV), a measure of arterial stiffness was tested in overweight men and postmenopausal women. Methods. 25 subjects, 11 postmenopausal women, 14 men (age, 57 [7] years; body mass index, 30.3 [4.7]kg/m(2); mean [S.D.]) participated in a double-blind, randomized, cross-over trial of THD versus placebo. Design. 2 weeks run-in followed by either THD 1g daily or placebo, each intervention 5 weeks. Aorta-femoral artery PWV, blood pressure and plasma lipids were measured after run-in, THD and placebo. Results. PWV was significantly reduced (signifying diminished central arterial stiffness): medians (25th and 75th%), placebo 9.9 m/s (8.7, 11.1), THD 8.8m/s (7.9, 10.9); RM ANOVA P=0.023, with Tukey procedure P<0.05. Systolic blood pressure was significantly reduced: means (S.D.), placebo 125.6 (14.7), THD 121.3 (12.2)mmHg; Tukey P<0.05. Plasma cholesterol, triglyceride and LDL cholesterol did not differ significantly. Absorption of THD >80% substantially exceeded that of parent isoflavones. Conclusion. A metabolite normally formed after consumption of isoflavones (formononetin, daidezein), taken orally, reduced blood pressure and central arterial stiffness indicating reduced cardiovascular risk.";Circulatory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train
19;16963472;The perindopril in elderly people with chronic heart failure (PEP-CHF) study.;"Aims. Many patients who receive a diagnosis of heart failure have neither a low left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction nor valve disease. Few substantial randomized controlled trials have been conducted in this population, none has focussed on patients with evidence of diastolic dysfunction and none has shown clear benefit on symptoms, morbidity, or mortality. Methods and results. This was a randomized double-blind trial, comparing placebo with perindopril, 4 mg/day in patients aged > or =70 years with a diagnosis of heart failure, treated with diuretics and an echocardiogram suggesting diastolic dysfunction and excluding substantial LV systolic dysfunction or valve disease. The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause mortality and unplanned heart failure related hospitalization with a minimum follow-up of 1 year. A total of 850 patients were randomized. Their mean age was 76 (SD 5) years and 55% were women. Median follow-up was 2.1 (IQR 1.5-2.8) years. Enrollment and event rates were lower than anticipated, reducing the power of the study to show a difference in the primary endpoint to 35%. Many patients withdrew from perindopril (28%) and placebo (26%) after 1 year and started taking open-label ACE-inhibitors. Overall, 107 patients assigned to placebo and 100 assigned to perindopril reached the primary endpoint (HR 0.919: 95% CI 0.700-1.208; P = 0.545). By 1 year, reductions in the primary outcome (HR 0.692: 95% CI 0.474-1.010; P = 0.055) and hospitalization for heart failure (HR 0.628: 95% CI 0.408-0.966; P = 0.033) were observed and functional class (P < 0.030) and 6-min corridor walk distance (P = 0.011) had improved in those assigned to perindopril. Conclusion. Uncertainty remains about the effects of perindopril on long-term morbidity and mortality in this clinical setting since this study had insufficient power for its primary endpoint. However, improved symptoms and exercise capacity and fewer hospitalizations for heart failure in the first year were observed on perindopril, during which most patients were on assigned therapy, suggesting that it may be of benefit in this patient population.";Circulatory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train
20;18035195;Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of a single intravenous dose of ibutilide fumarate: a phase I, randomized, open-label, increasing-dose study in healthy Chinese men.;"Background. Atrial flutter is a common sustained atrial tachyarrhythmia whose frequency increases with age. Ibutilide is a class III antiarrhythmic agent used for the cardioversion of atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation. Objective. This study assessed the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic properties and tolerability of a single intravenous dose of ibutilide fumarate in healthy Chinese men. Methods. This Phase I, randomized, open-label, increasing-dose trial was conducted at the Clinical Pharmacology Center, Cardiovascular Institute and Fu Wai Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College in Beijing, People's Republic of China. Healthy, nonsmoking men aged 18 to 45 years and weighing within 15% of their ideal height/weight range were randomly assigned to 1 of 6 treatment groups: ibutilide 0.005, 0.01, or 0.02 mg/kg, or 0.5, 0.75, or 1.0 mg. Each volunteer received a 10-minute infusion of ibutilide under fasting conditions. For analysis of PK properties, blood samples were obtained at the following times: immediately before administration of study drug; 3, 5, 8, 10, 30, and 60 minutes after administration; and 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours after administration. Plasma ibutilide concentrations were determined using a validated high- performance liquid chromatography method with tandem mass-spectrometric detection. Continuous electrocardiographic monitoring was performed, and 12-lead electrocardiograms were recorded before dosing and at defined times from the start of infusion until 24 hours after dosing. Tolerability was assessed throughout the study based on physical examinations, measurement of vital signs, laboratory analyses, and monitoring of adverse effects. Results. Forty healthy Chinese men were enrolled (mean [SD] age, 24.0 [3.9] years [range, 19-36 years]; mean [SD] body weight, 62.8 [7.9] kg [range, 48- 80 kg]). The plasma ibutilide end-of-infusion concentration and AUC(0-infinity) increased approximately linearly with increasing doses of ibutilide. No statistically significant differences in the principal PK parameters were found among dosage groups; t(1/2) ranged from 7.5 to 9.1 hours, systemic clearance from 68 to 85 mL/min per kg, and Vd from 51 to 60 L/kg. The mean QTc interval was significantly increased during and after ibutilide infusion (baseline range, 406-418 milliseconds; maximum range, 469-683 milliseconds; P < 0.05 vs baseline). The changes in QTc interval were dose dependent, and there was a significant correlation between plasma ibutilide concentrations and changes in the QTc interval (r = 0.7244; P < 0.01). There were no significant changes in blood pressure or the QRS and PR intervals. One volunteer complained of dizziness, but no other apparent adverse effects were observed. Conclusions. The results of this study in a selected population of healthy Chinese men suggest that the PK properties of ibutilide are linear with respect to dosing. A single intravenous dose of ibutilide prolonged the QTc interval in a dose- and concentration- dependent manner. Ibutilide was generally well tolerated.";Circulatory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Test

Trials of beta blockers in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery have reported conflicting results. This randomised controlled trial, done in 190 hospitals in 23 countries, was designed to investigate the effects of perioperative beta blockers. Methods. We randomly assigned 8351 patients with, or at risk of, atherosclerotic disease who were undergoing non-cardiac surgery to receive extended-release metoprolol succinate (n=4174) or placebo (n=4177), by a computerised randomisation phone service. Study treatment was started 2-4 h before surgery and continued for 30 days. Patients, health-care providers, data collectors, and outcome adjudicators were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was a composite of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal cardiac arrest. Analyses were by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00182039. Findings. All 8351 patients were included in analyses; 8331 (99.8%) patients completed the 30-day follow-up. Fewer patients in the metoprolol group than in the placebo group reached the primary endpoint (244 [5.8%] patients in the metoprolol group vs 290 [6.9%] in the placebo group; hazard ratio 0.84, 95% CI 0.70-0.99; p=0.0399). Fewer patients in the metoprolol group than in the placebo group had a myocardial infarction (176 [4.2%] vs 239 [5.7%] patients; 0.73, 0.60-0.89; p=0.0017). However, there were more deaths in the metoprolol group than in the placebo group (129 [3.1%] vs 97 [2.3%] patients; 1.33, 1.03-1.74; p=0.0317). More patients in the metoprolol group than in the placebo group had a stroke (41 [1.0%] vs 19 [0.5%] patients; 2.17, 1.26-3.74; p=0.0053). Interpretation. Our results highlight the risk in assuming a perioperative beta-blocker regimen has benefit without substantial harm, and the importance and need for large randomised trials in the perioperative setting.

22;18662287;Lamotrigine does not prolong QTc in a thorough QT/QTc study in healthy subjects.;Aim. To characterize the effects of lamotrigine on QT interval in healthy subjects. Methods. Healthy subjects received a single oral dose of moxifloxacin (400 mg) or placebo in crossover design, followed by a dose-escalating regimen of lamotrigine (n = 76) over a 77-day period, or matched placebo (n = 76). Blood samples were taken for determination of moxifloxacin and lamotrigine concentrations and digital 12-lead ECGs were recorded. The relationships between individual QT values and respective individual moxifloxacin or lamotrigine concentrations were explored using population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) modelling. Results. Moxifloxacin was associated with a maximum mean increase from baseline in QTcF of 14.81 ms [90% confidence interval (CI) 13.50, 16.11] 2.5 h after dosing. Steady-state exposure to lamotrigine (50, 150 or 200 mg b.d.) was not associated with an increase in QTc interval. Small reductions in QTcF (maximum mean difference from placebo -7.48 ms, 90% CI -10.49, -4.46) and small increases in heart rate (maximum mean difference from placebo 5.94 bpm, 90% CI 3.81, 8.06) were observed with lamotrigine 200 mg b.d. vs. placebo. No effect of lamotrigine on QRS duration or blood pressure was observed. No outliers with QTcF > 450 ms, or with an increase from baseline of >60 ms were observed in the lamotrigine group. PK-PD modelling indicated statistically significant decreases in individually corrected QT intervals for lamotrigine and statistically significant increases in individually corrected QT intervals for moxifloxacin over the concentration ranges studied. Conclusions. Therapeutic doses of lamotrigine (50-200 mg b.d.) were not associated with QT prolongation in healthy subjects.;Circulatory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train
23;18765433;Intensive lipid lowering with simvastatin and ezetimibe in aortic stenosis.;"Background. Hyperlipidemia has been suggested as a risk factor for stenosis of the aortic valve, but lipid-lowering studies have had conflicting results. Methods. We conducted a randomized, double-blind trial involving 1873 patients with mild-to-moderate, asymptomatic aortic stenosis. The patients received either 40 mg of simvastatin plus 10 mg of ezetimibe or placebo daily. The primary outcome was a composite of major cardiovascular events, including death from cardiovascular causes, aortic-valve replacement, nonfatal myocardial infarction, hospitalization for unstable angina pectoris, heart failure, coronary-artery bypass grafting, percutaneous coronary intervention, and nonhemorrhagic stroke. Secondary outcomes were events related to aortic-valve stenosis and ischemic cardiovascular events. Results. During a median follow-up of 52.2 months, the primary outcome occurred in 333 patients (35.3%) in the simvastatin-ezetimibe group and in 355 patients (38.2%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio in the simvastatin-ezetimibe group, 0.96; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.83 to 1.12; P=0.59). Aortic-valve replacement was performed in 267 patients (28.3%) in the simvastatin-ezetimibe group and in 278 patients (29.9%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.84 to 1.18; P=0.97). Fewer patients had ischemic cardiovascular events in the simvastatin-ezetimibe group (148 patients) than in the placebo group (187 patients) (hazard ratio, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.63 to 0.97; P=0.02), mainly because of the smaller number of patients who underwent coronary-artery bypass grafting. Cancer occurred more frequently in the simvastatin-ezetimibe group (105 vs. 70, P=0.01). Conclusions. Simvastatin and ezetimibe did not reduce the composite outcome of combined aortic-valve events and ischemic events in patients with aortic stenosis. Such therapy reduced the incidence of ischemic cardiovascular events but not events related to aortic-valve stenosis.

Angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) are effective treatments for patients with heart failure, but the relation between dose and clinical outcomes has not been explored. We compared the effects of high-dose versus low-dose losartan on clinical outcomes in patients with heart failure. Methods. This double-blind trial was undertaken in 255 sites in 30 countries. 3846 patients with heart failure of New York Heart Association class II-IV, left-ventricular ejection fraction 40% or less, and intolerance to angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors were randomly assigned to losartan 150 mg (n=1927) or 50 mg daily (n=1919). Allocation was by block randomisation stratified by centre and presence or absence of beta-blocker therapy, and all patients and investigators were masked to assignment. The primary endpoint was death or admission for heart failure. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00090259. Findings. Six patients in each group were excluded because of poor data quality. With 4.7-year median follow-up in each group (IQR 3.7-5.5 for losartan 150 mg; 3.4-5.5 for losartan 50 mg), 828 (43%) patients in the 150 mg group versus 889 (46%) in the 50 mg group died or were admitted for heart failure (hazard ratio [HR] 0.90, 95% CI 0.82-0.99; p=0.027). For the two primary endpoint components, 635 patients in the 150 mg group versus 665 in the 50 mg group died (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.84-1.04; p=0.24), and 450 versus 503 patients were admitted for heart failure (0.87, 0.76-0.98; p=0.025). Renal impairment (n=454 vs 317), hypotension (203 vs 145), and hyperkalaemia (195 vs 131) were more common in the 150 mg group than in the 50 mg group, but these adverse events did not lead to significantly more treatment discontinuations in the 150 mg group. Interpretation. Losartan 150 mg daily reduced the rate of death or admission for heart failure in patients with heart failure, reduced left-ventricular ejection fraction, and intolerance to ACE inhibitors compared with losartan 50 mg daily. These findings show the value of up-titrating ARB doses to confer clinical benefit. Funding. Merck (USA).";Circulatory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train
25;20228404;Effects of combination lipid therapy in type 2 diabetes mellitus.;"Background We investigated whether combination therapy with a statin plus a fibrate, as compared with statin monotherapy, would reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who were at high risk for cardiovascular disease. Methods We randomly assigned 5518 patients with type 2 diabetes who were being treated with open-label simvastatin to receive either masked fenofibrate or placebo. The primary outcome was the first occurrence of nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes. The mean follow-up was 4.7 years. Results The annual rate of the primary outcome was 2.2% in the fenofibrate group and 2.4% in the placebo group (hazard ratio in the fenofibrate group, 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.79 to 1.08; P=0.32). There were also no significant differences between the two study groups with respect to any secondary outcome. Annual rates of death were 1.5% in the fenofibrate group and 1.6% in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.75 to 1.10; P=0.33). Prespecified subgroup analyses suggested heterogeneity in treatment effect according to sex, with a benefit for men and possible harm for women (P=0.01 for interaction), and a possible interaction according to lipid subgroup, with a possible benefit for patients with both a high baseline triglyceride level and a low baseline level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P=0.057 for interaction). Conclusions The combination of fenofibrate and simvastatin did not reduce the rate of fatal cardiovascular events, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke, as compared with simvastatin alone. These results do not support the routine use of combination therapy with fenofibrate and simvastatin to reduce cardiovascular risk in the majority of high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes.

26;20525999;Ezetimibe alone or in combination with simvastatin increases small dense low-density lipoproteins in healthy men: a randomized trial.;"Aims The predominance of small dense low-density lipoproteins (sdLDLs) has been associated with increased cardiovascular risk. The effect of ezetimibe on LDL subfraction distribution has not been fully elucidated. This study assessed by gradient gel electrophoresis the effects of ezetimibe alone, simvastatin alone, and their combination on sdLDL subfraction distribution. Methods and results A single-centre, randomized, parallel three-group open-label study was performed in 72 healthy men with a baseline LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) concentration of 111 +/- 30 mg/dL (2.9 +/- 0.8 mmol/L). They were treated with ezetimibe (10 mg/day, n = 24), simvastatin (40 mg/day, n = 24), or their combination (n = 24) for 14 days. Blood was drawn before and after the treatment period. Generalized estimating equations were used to assess the influence of drug therapy on LDL subfraction distribution, controlling for within-subject patterns (clustering). We adjusted for age, body mass index, and baseline concentrations of LDL-C and triglycerides. Ezetimibe alone changed LDL subfraction distribution towards a more atherogenic profile by significantly increasing sdLDL subfractions (LDL-IVA +14.2%, P = 0.0216 and LDL-IVB +16.7%, P = 0.039; fully adjusted Wald chi(2) test). In contrast, simvastatin alone significantly decreased the LDL-IVB subfraction (-16.7%, P = 0.002). This effect was offset when simvastatin was combined with ezetimibe (LDL-IVB +14.3%, P = 0.44). All three treatments decreased the large, more buoyant LDL-I subfraction, the effects of ezetimibe being the most pronounced (ezetimibe -13.9%, P < 0.0001; combination therapy -7.3%, P = 0.0743; simvastatin -4.6%, P < 0.0001). Conclusion In healthy men, treatment with ezetimibe alone is associated with the development of a pro-atherogenic LDL subfraction profile. Potentially atheroprotective effects of simvastatin are offset by ezetimibe. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier no.

In parallel, we carried out a double-blind, randomized, event-driven superiority study that compared rivaroxaban alone (20 mg once daily) with placebo for an additional 6 or 12 months in patients who had completed 6 to 12 months of treatment for venous thromboembolism. The primary efficacy outcome for both studies was recurrent venous thromboembolism. The principal safety outcome was major bleeding or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding in the initial-treatment study and major bleeding in the continued-treatment study. Results. The study of rivaroxaban for acute DVT included 3449 patients: 1731 given rivaroxaban and 1718 given enoxaparin plus a vitamin K antagonist. Rivaroxaban had noninferior efficacy with respect to the primary outcome (36 events [2.1%], vs. 51 events with enoxaparin-vitamin K antagonist [3.0%]; hazard ratio, 0.68; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.44 to 1.04; P<0.001). The principal safety outcome occurred in 8.1% of the patients in each group. In the continued-treatment study, which included 602 patients in the rivaroxaban group and 594 in the placebo group, rivaroxaban had superior efficacy (8 events [1.3%], vs. 42 with placebo [7.1%]; hazard ratio, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.09 to 0.39; P<0.001). Four patients in the rivaroxaban group had nonfatal major bleeding (0.7%), versus none in the placebo group (P=0.11). Conclusions. Rivaroxaban offers a simple, single-drug approach to the short-term and continued treatment of venous thrombosis that may improve the benefit-to-risk profile of anticoagulation.

28;21454813;Effects of a single dose of dantrolene in patients with cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage: a prospective pilot study.;"Background and purpose. New therapies for cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage are needed because of its high morbidity and mortality rates. We investigated the feasibility and safety of a single dose of intravenous dantrolene and its effect on transcranial Doppler in cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage. Methods. In a prospective, open-label, single-dose ascending safety trial, 5 patients received intravenous dantrolene 1.25 mg/kg and the next 5 patients received 2.5 mg/kg over the course of 60 minutes. All other infusions were kept steady and hemodynamic parameters were recorded. Transcranial Doppler was performed at 0, 45, 90, and 135 minutes relative to infusion start. Basic chemistries, serum osmolality, arterial blood gas, and liver enzymes were measured before and after. Results. Laboratory values and hemodynamic parameters remained unchanged except for a decrease in the systolic blood pressure in the low-dose group (-8 mm Hg; 95% CI, -26 to 10 mm Hg; P=0.027). After correcting for this decrease in blood pressure, peak systolic transcranial Doppler velocities decreased significantly (-26 cm/s; 95% CI, -47 to -5 cm/s; P=0.02), with a borderline change in mean velocities in the low-dose group (-16 cm/s; 95% CI, -36 to 4 cm/s; P=0.07) and peak systolic transcranial Doppler velocity in the high-dose group (-26 cm/s; 95% CI, -56 to 5 cm/s; P=0.05). Conclusions. In this pilot study, a single dose of intravenous dantrolene in cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage appears feasible while inhibiting vasoconstriction in the low-dose group, but it may lower blood pressure. Our study provides useful data for the design of larger future studies. Clinical Trial Registration- URL: http://clinicaltrials.gov.

29;21825004;Combined transcranial direct current stimulation and robot-assisted arm training in subacute stroke patients: an exploratory, randomized multicenter trial.;"Background. No rehabilitation intervention has effectively improved functional use of the arm and hand in patients with severe upper limb paresis after stroke. Pilot studies suggest the potential for transcranial direct current stimulation and bilateral robotic training to enhance gains. Objective. In a double-blind, randomized trial the combination of these interventions was tested. Methods. This study randomized 96 patients with an ischemic supratentorial lesion of 3 to 8 weeks' duration with severe impairment of motor control with a Fugl-Meyer score (FMS) for the upper limb <18 into 3 groups. For 6 weeks, group A received anodal stimulation of the lesioned hemisphere, group B received cathodal stimulation of the nonlesioned side for 20 minutes at 2.0 mA, and group C received sham stimulation. The electrodes were placed over the hand area and above the contralateral orbit. Contemporaneously, the subjects practiced 400 repetitions each of 2 different bilateral movements on a robotic assistive device. Results. The groups were matched at onset. The FMS improved in all patients at 6 weeks (P < .001). No between-group differences were found; initial versus finish FMS scores were 7.8 ± 3.8 versus 19.1 ± 14.4 in group A, 7.9 ± 3.4 versus 18.8 ± 10.5 in group B, and 8.2 ± 4.4 versus 19.2 ± 15.0 in group C. No significant changes between groups were present at 3 months. Conclusions. Neither anodal nor cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation enhanced the effect of bilateral arm training in this exploratory trial of patients with cortical involvement and severe weakness. Unilateral hand training and upregulation of the nonlesioned hemisphere might also be tried in this population.";Circulatory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train
30;21830957;Rivaroxaban versus warfarin in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation.;"Background. The use of warfarin reduces the rate of ischemic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation but requires frequent monitoring and dose adjustment. Rivaroxaban, an oral factor Xa inhibitor, may provide more consistent and predictable anticoagulation than warfarin. Methods. In a double-blind trial, we randomly assigned 14,264 patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation who were at increased risk for stroke to receive either rivaroxaban (at a daily dose of 20 mg) or dose-adjusted warfarin. The per-protocol, as-treated primary analysis was designed to determine whether rivaroxaban was noninferior to warfarin for the primary end point of stroke or systemic embolism. Results. In the primary analysis, the primary end point occurred in 188 patients in the rivaroxaban group (1.7% per year) and in 241 in the warfarin group (2.2% per year) (hazard ratio in the rivaroxaban group, 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.66 to 0.96; P<0.001 for noninferiority). In the intention-to-treat analysis, the primary end point occurred in 269 patients in the rivaroxaban group (2.1% per year) and in 306 patients in the warfarin group (2.4% per year) (hazard ratio, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.74 to 1.03; P<0.001 for noninferiority; P=0.12 for superiority). Major and nonmajor clinically relevant bleeding occurred in 1475 patients in the rivaroxaban group (14.9% per year) and in 1449 in the warfarin group (14.5% per year) (hazard ratio, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.96 to 1.11; P=0.44), with significant reductions in intracranial hemorrhage (0.5% vs. 0.7%, P=0.02) and fatal bleeding (0.2% vs. 0.5%, P=0.003) in the rivaroxaban group. Conclusions. In patients with atrial fibrillation, rivaroxaban was noninferior to warfarin for the prevention of stroke or systemic embolism. There was no significant between-group difference in the risk of major bleeding, although intracranial and fatal bleeding occurred less frequently in the rivaroxaban group.

31;21870978;Apixaban versus warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation.;"Background. Vitamin K antagonists are highly effective in preventing stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation but have several limitations. Apixaban is a novel oral direct factor Xa inhibitor that has been shown to reduce the risk of stroke in a similar population in comparison with aspirin. Methods. In this randomized, double-blind trial, we compared apixaban (at a dose of 5 mg twice daily) with warfarin (target international normalized ratio, 2.0 to 3.0) in 18,201 patients with atrial fibrillation and at least one additional risk factor for stroke. The primary outcome was ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke or systemic embolism. The trial was designed to test for noninferiority, with key secondary objectives of testing for superiority with respect to the primary outcome and to the rates of major bleeding and death from any cause. Results. The median duration of follow-up was 1.8 years. The rate of the primary outcome was 1.27% per year in the apixaban group, as compared with 1.60% per year in the warfarin group (hazard ratio with apixaban, 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.66 to 0.95; P<0.001 for noninferiority; P=0.01 for superiority). The rate of major bleeding was 2.13% per year in the apixaban group, as compared with 3.09% per year in the warfarin group (hazard ratio, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.60 to 0.80; P<0.001), and the rates of death from any cause were 3.52% and 3.94%, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.80 to 0.99; P=0.047). The rate of hemorrhagic stroke was 0.24% per year in the apixaban group, as compared with 0.47% per year in the warfarin group (hazard ratio, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.35 to 0.75; P<0.001), and the rate of ischemic or uncertain type of stroke was 0.97% per year in the apixaban group and 1.05% per year in the warfarin group (hazard ratio, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.74 to 1.13; P=0.42). Conclusions. In patients with atrial fibrillation, apixaban was superior to warfarin in preventing stroke or systemic embolism, caused less bleeding, and resulted in lower mortality.

32;22077192;Rivaroxaban in patients with a recent acute coronary syndrome.;"Background. Acute coronary syndromes arise from coronary atherosclerosis with superimposed thrombosis. Since factor Xa plays a central role in thrombosis, the inhibition of factor Xa with low-dose rivaroxaban might improve cardiovascular outcomes in patients with a recent acute coronary syndrome. Methods. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we randomly assigned 15,526 patients with a recent acute coronary syndrome to receive twice-daily doses of either 2.5 mg or 5 mg of rivaroxaban or placebo for a mean of 13 months and up to 31 months. The primary efficacy end point was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction, or stroke. Results. Rivaroxaban significantly reduced the primary efficacy end point, as compared with placebo, with respective rates of 8.9% and 10.7% (hazard ratio in the rivaroxaban group, 0.84; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.74 to 0.96; P=0.008), with significant improvement for both the twice-daily 2.5-mg dose (9.1% vs. 10.7%, P=0.02) and the twice-daily 5-mg dose (8.8% vs. 10.7%, P=0.03). The twice-daily 2.5-mg dose of rivaroxaban reduced the rates of death from cardiovascular causes (2.7% vs. 4.1%, P=0.002) and from any cause (2.9% vs. 4.5%, P=0.002), a survival benefit that was not seen with the twice-daily 5-mg dose. As compared with placebo, rivaroxaban increased the rates of major bleeding not related to coronary-artery bypass grafting (2.1% vs. 0.6%, P<0.001) and intracranial hemorrhage (0.6% vs. 0.2%, P=0.009), without a significant increase in fatal bleeding (0.3% vs. 0.2%, P=0.66) or other adverse events. The twice-daily 2.5-mg dose resulted in fewer fatal bleeding events than the twice-daily 5-mg dose (0.1% vs. 0.4%, P=0.04). Conclusions. In patients with a recent acute coronary syndrome, rivaroxaban reduced the risk of the composite end point of death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction, or stroke. Rivaroxaban increased the risk of major bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage but not the risk of fatal bleeding.

33;22336473;Cilostazol versus aspirin therapy in patients with chronic dizziness after ischemic stroke.;"Background. Chronic dizziness is frequently reported by patients in the chronic stage after ischemic stroke. The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of cilostazol versus that of aspirin for the chronic dizziness that follows ischemic stroke. Methods. We performed a prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded endpoint trial. One hundred six patients who suffered supratentorial ischemic stroke within the previous 1-6 months and subsequently complained of persistent dizziness without other obvious sequelae were enrolled. Patients were randomly given cilostazol (200mg/day) or aspirin (100mg/day) for 6 months. Rates of improvement in the dizziness were then evaluated. Changes in fixation suppression of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (an indicator of cerebral control over the brainstem reflex related to balance), regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the cerebrum, cerebellum, and brainstem; and the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) were also evaluated. Results. Dizziness was significantly improved in the cilostazol group versus the aspirin group (P<0.0001) after the 6-month therapy. The capacity for fixation suppression of the vestibulo-ocular reflex was improved (P<0.0001), and regional CBF in the cerebrum (relative to that in the brainstem [P=0.003] and to that in the cerebello-brainstem [P=0.012]) was increased only in the cilostazol group. There was no statistical difference in the change in SDS scores between the two groups. Conclusion. Cilostazol improves the chronic dizziness that follows ischemic stroke and increases supratentorial CBF and cerebral function for adaptation of the brainstem reflex related to the sense of balance.";Circulatory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train
34;22492518;Intracranial hemorrhage in atrial fibrillation patients during anticoagulation with warfarin or dabigatran: the RE-LY trial.;"Background and purpose. Intracranial hemorrhage is the most devastating complication of anticoagulation. Outcomes associated with different sites of intracranial bleeding occurring with warfarin versus dabigatran have not been defined. Methods. Analysis of 18 113 participants with atrial fibrillation in the Randomized Evaluation of Long-term anticoagulant therapY (RE-LY) trial assigned to adjusted-dose warfarin (target international normalized ratio, 2-3) or dabigatran (150 mg or 110 mg, both twice daily). Results. During a mean of 2.0 years of follow-up, 154 intracranial hemorrhages occurred in 153 participants: 46% intracerebral (49% mortality), 45% subdural (24% mortality), and 8% subarachnoid (31% mortality). The rates of intracranial hemorrhage were 0.76%, 0.31%, and 0.23% per year among those assigned to warfarin, dabigatran 150 mg, and dabigatran 110 mg, respectively (P<0.001 for either dabigatran dose versus warfarin). Fewer fatal intracranial hemorrhages occurred among those assigned dabigatran 150 mg and 110 mg (n=13 and n=11, respectively) versus warfarin (n=32; P<0.01 for both). Fewer traumatic intracranial hemorrhages occurred among those assigned to dabigatran (11 patients with each dose) compared with warfarin (24 patients; P<0.05 for both dabigatran doses versus warfarin). Independent predictors of intracranial hemorrhage were assignment to warfarin (relative risk, 2.9; P<0.001), aspirin use (relative risk, 1.6; P=0.01), age (relative risk, 1.1 per year; P<0.001), and previous stroke/transient ischemic attack (relative risk, 1.8; P=0.001). Conclusions. The clinical spectrum of intracranial hemorrhage was similar for patients given warfarin and dabigatran. Absolute rates at all sites and both fatal and traumatic intracranial hemorrhages were lower with dabigatran than with warfarin. Concomitant aspirin use was the most important modifiable independent risk factor for intracranial hemorrhage.";Circulatory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train
35;22632908;The benefits and harms of intravenous thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator within 6 h of acute ischaemic stroke (the third international stroke trial [IST-3]): a randomised controlled trial.;"Background. Thrombolysis is of net benefit in patients with acute ischaemic stroke, who are younger than 80 years of age and are treated within 4·5 h of onset. The third International Stroke Trial (IST-3) sought to determine whether a wider range of patients might benefit up to 6 h from stroke onset. Methods. In this international, multicentre, randomised, open-treatment trial, patients were allocated to 0·9 mg/kg intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) or to control. The primary analysis was of the proportion of patients alive and independent, as defined by an Oxford Handicap Score (OHS) of 0-2 at 6 months. The study is registered, ISRCTN25765518. Findings. 3035 patients were enrolled by 156 hospitals in 12 countries. All of these patients were included in the analyses (1515 in the rt-PA group vs 1520 in the control group), of whom 1617 (53%) were older than 80 years of age. At 6 months, 554 (37%) patients in the rt-PA group versus 534 (35%) in the control group were alive and independent (OHS 0-2; adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1·13, 95% CI 0·95-1·35, p=0·181; a non-significant absolute increase of 14/1000, 95% CI -20 to 48). An ordinal analysis showed a significant shift in OHS scores; common OR 1·27 (95% CI 1·10-1·47, p=0·001). Fatal or non-fatal symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage within 7 days occurred in 104 (7%) patients in the rt-PA group versus 16 (1%) in the control group (adjusted OR 6·94, 95% CI 4·07-11·8; absolute excess 58/1000, 95% CI 44-72). More deaths occurred within 7 days in the rt-PA group (163 [11%]) than in the control group (107 [7%], adjusted OR 1·60, 95% CI 1·22-2·08, p=0·001; absolute increase 37/1000, 95% CI 17-57), but between 7 days and 6 months there were fewer deaths in the rt-PA group than in the control group, so that by 6 months, similar numbers, in total, had died (408 [27%] in the rt-PA group vs 407 [27%] in the control group). Interpretation. For the types of patient recruited in IST-3, despite the early hazards, thrombolysis within 6 h improved functional outcome. Benefit did not seem to be diminished in elderly patients.

36;22686416;Basal insulin and cardiovascular and other outcomes in dysglycemia.;"Background The provision of sufficient basal insulin to normalize fasting plasma glucose levels may reduce cardiovascular events, but such a possibility has not been formally tested. Methods We randomly assigned 12,537 people (mean age, 63.5 years) with cardiovascular risk factors plus impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, or type 2 diabetes to receive insulin glargine (with a target fasting blood glucose level of ≤95 mg per deciliter [5.3 mmol per liter]) or standard care and to receive n-3 fatty acids or placebo with the use of a 2-by-2 factorial design. The results of the comparison between insulin glargine and standard care are reported here. The coprimary outcomes were nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes and these events plus revascularization or hospitalization for heart failure. Microvascular outcomes, incident diabetes, hypoglycemia, weight, and cancers were also compared between groups. Results The median follow-up was 6.2 years (interquartile range, 5.8 to 6.7). Rates of incident cardiovascular outcomes were similar in the insulin-glargine and standard-care groups: 2.94 and 2.85 per 100 person-years, respectively, for the first coprimary outcome (hazard ratio, 1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.94 to 1.11; P=0.63) and 5.52 and 5.28 per 100 person-years, respectively, for the second coprimary outcome (hazard ratio, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.97 to 1.11; P=0.27). New diabetes was diagnosed approximately 3 months after therapy was stopped among 30% versus 35% of 1456 participants without baseline diabetes (odds ratio, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.64 to 1.00; P=0.05). Rates of severe hypoglycemia were 1.00 versus 0.31 per 100 person-years. Median weight increased by 1.6 kg in the insulin-glargine group and fell by 0.5 kg in the standard-care group. There was no significant difference in cancers (hazard ratio, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.88 to 1.13; P=0.97). Conclusions When used to target normal fasting plasma glucose levels for more than 6 years, insulin glargine had a neutral effect on cardiovascular outcomes and cancers. Although it reduced new-onset diabetes, insulin glargine also increased hypoglycemia and modestly increased weight.

37;22914079;A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled pilot trial of anticoagulation in low-risk traumatic brain injury: The Delayed Versus Early Enoxaparin Prophylaxis I (DEEP I) study.;"Background. Our group has created an algorithm for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis after traumatic brain injury (TBI), which stratifies patients into low, moderate, and high risk for spontaneous injury progression and tailors a prophylaxis regimen to each arm. We present the results of the Delayed Versus Early Enoxaparin Prophylaxis I study, a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized pilot trial on the low-risk arm. Methods. In this two-institution study, patients presenting within 6 hours of injury with prespecified small TBI patterns and stable scans at 24 hours after injury were randomized to receive enoxaparin 30 mg bid or placebo from 24 to 96 hours after injury in a double-blind fashion. An additional computed tomography scan was obtained on all subjects 24 hours after starting treatment (and therefore 48 hours after injury). The primary end point was the radiographic worsening of TBI; secondary end points were venous thromboembolism occurrence and extracranial hemorrhagic complications. Results. A total of 683 consecutive patients with TBI were screened during the 28 center months. The most common exclusions were for injuries larger than the prespecified criteria (n = 199) and preinjury anticoagulant use (n = 138). Sixty-two patients were randomized to enoxaparin (n = 34) or placebo (n = 28). Subclinical, radiographic TBI progression rates on the scans performed 48 hours after injury and 24 hours after start of treatment were 5.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.7-19.7%) for enoxaparin and 3.6% (95% CI, 0.1-18.3%) for placebo, a treatment effect difference of 2.3% (95% CI, -14.42-16.5%). No clinical TBI progressions occurred. One deep vein thrombosis occurred in the placebo arm. Conclusion. TBI progression rates after starting enoxaparin in small, stable injuries 24 hours after injury are similar to those of placebo and are subclinical. The next Delayed Versus Early Enoxaparin Prophylaxis studies will assess efficacy of this practice in a powered study on the low-risk arm and a pilot trial of safety of a 72-hour time point in the moderate-risk arm.

38;23261172;Proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 is elevated in proteinuric subjects: relationship with lipoprotein response to antiproteinuric treatment.;"Objective. LDL-receptor deficiency may provide a mechanism which contributes to atherogenic lipoprotein abnormalities in experimental nephrosis and in humans with glomerular proteinuria. The proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9) pathway plays a key role in lipoprotein metabolism by promoting LDL-receptor degradation. We tested whether plasma PCSK9 is elevated in proteinuric states, and determined relationships of PCSK9 with lipoprotein responses to proteinuria reduction. Methods. Thirty-nine kidney patients (e-GFR 61 ± 29 mL/min/1.73 m(2), proteinuria 1.9 [0.9-3.3] g/day; 19 on statin treatment) were studied during 2 randomized double-blind 6-week periods on either lisinopril (40 mg/day) and a regular sodium diet (194 ± 49 mmol Na+/day; baseline treatment) or lisinopril plus valsartan (320 mg/day) and a low sodium diet (102 ± 52 mmol Na(+)/day; maximal treatment), and compared to age- and sex-matched controls. Maximal treatment decreased proteinuria to 0.5 [0.3-1.1] g/day (P < 0.001). Results. Plasma PCSK9 was increased at baseline in proteinuric subjects (213 [161-314] vs. 143 [113-190] ug/L in controls, P ≤ 0.001), irrespective of statin use, e-GFR and BMI. PCSK9 correlated with proteinuria at baseline (R = 0.399, P = 0.018) and at maximal antiproteinuric treatment (R = 0.525, P = 0.001), but did not decrease during proteinuria reduction (P = 0.84). Individual changes in total cholesterol (R = 0.365, P = 0.024), non-HDL cholesterol (R = 0.333, P = 0.041), and LDL cholesterol (R = 0.346, P = 0.033) were correlated positively with individual PCSK9 responses. PCSK9 at baseline independently predicted the total/HDL cholesterol ratio response to treatment (P = 0.04). Conclusion. Plasma PCSK9 was elevated in proteinuria, predicted lipoprotein responses to proteinuria reduction but remained unchanged after proteinuria reduction. Inhibition of the PCSK9 pathway may provide a novel treatment strategy in proteinuric subjects.";Circulatory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train

The objective of this study was to determine whether colchicine 0.5 mg/day can reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with clinically stable coronary disease. Background. The presence of activated neutrophils in culprit atherosclerotic plaques of patients with unstable coronary disease raises the possibility that inhibition of neutrophil function with colchicine may reduce the risk of plaque instability and thereby improve clinical outcomes in patients with stable coronary disease. Methods. In a clinical trial with a prospective, randomized, observer-blinded endpoint design, 532 patients with stable coronary disease receiving aspirin and/or clopidogrel (93%) and statins (95%) were randomly assigned colchicine 0.5 mg/day or no colchicine and followed for a median of 3 years. The primary outcome was the composite incidence of acute coronary syndrome, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, or noncardioembolic ischemic stroke. The primary analysis was by intention-to-treat. Results. The primary outcome occurred in 15 of 282 patients (5.3%) who received colchicine and 40 of 250 patients (16.0%) assigned no colchicine (hazard ratio: 0.33; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.18 to 0.59; p < 0.001; number needed to treat: 11). In a pre-specified secondary on-treatment analysis that excluded 32 patients (11%) assigned to colchicine who withdrew within 30 days due to intestinal intolerance and a further 7 patients (2%) who did not start treatment, the primary outcome occurred in 4.5% versus 16.0% (hazard ratio: 0.29; 95% CI: 0.15 to 0.56; p < 0.001).

40;23387822;Endovascular treatment for acute ischemic stroke.;"Background. In patients with ischemic stroke, endovascular treatment results in a higher rate of recanalization of the affected cerebral artery than systemic intravenous thrombolytic therapy. However, comparison of the clinical efficacy of the two approaches is needed. Methods. We randomly assigned 362 patients with acute ischemic stroke, within 4.5 hours after onset, to endovascular therapy (intraarterial thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator [t-PA], mechanical clot disruption or retrieval, or a combination of these approaches) or intravenous t-PA. Treatments were to be given as soon as possible after randomization. The primary outcome was survival free of disability (defined as a modified Rankin score of 0 or 1 on a scale of 0 to 6, with 0 indicating no symptoms, 1 no clinically significant disability despite symptoms, and 6 death) at 3 months. Results. A total of 181 patients were assigned to receive endovascular therapy, and 181 intravenous t-PA. The median time from stroke onset to the start of treatment was 3.75 hours for endovascular therapy and 2.75 hours for intravenous t-PA (P<0.001). At 3 months, 55 patients in the endovascular-therapy group (30.4%) and 63 in the intravenous t-PA group (34.8%) were alive without disability (odds ratio adjusted for age, sex, stroke severity, and atrial fibrillation status at baseline, 0.71; 95% confidence interval, 0.44 to 1.14; P=0.16). Fatal or nonfatal symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within 7 days occurred in 6% of the patients in each group, and there were no significant differences between groups in the rates of other serious adverse events or the case fatality rate. Conclusions. The results of this trial in patients with acute ischemic stroke indicate that endovascular therapy is not superior to standard treatment with intravenous t-PA.

41;23524525;Ultrasonography modifications of visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue after pioglitazone or glibenclamide therapy combined with rosuvastatin in type 2 diabetic patients not well controlled by metformin.;"Aim To compare pioglitazone or glibenclamide alone and in combination with rosuvastatin on hepatic steatosis in type 2 diabetic patients. Materials and methods After 3 months of metformin, patients were randomized to add pioglitazone 15 mg twice a day or glibenclamide 5 mg twice a day for 6 months, and then rosuvastatin 5 mg was added for other 6 months. Patients underwent an ultrasound examination for evaluation of steatosis degree, subcutaneous adipose tissue, and visceral adipose tissue diameter, an euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp, and blood sample collection for evaluation of glycemic control, fasting plasma insulin, lipid profile, adipocytokines at randomization, and after 6 and 12 months. Results Both pioglitazone and glibenclamide improved glycemic control. Pioglitazone reduced fasting plasma insulin, whereas glibenclamide increased it. Pioglitazone increased the glucose infusion rate compared with glibenclamide. Pioglitazone, but not glibenclamide, improved the lipid profile, and, when rosuvastatin was added, there was a greater improvement with pioglitazone and rosuvastatin. Adiponectin was increased by pioglitazone (+0.5 μg/ml), with a further increase (+0.4 μg/ml) when rosuvastatin was added. A significant decrease in leptin (-3.1 ng/ml) and interleukin-6 (-0.4 pg/ml) was found only with pioglitazone; a similar trend (-2.5 ng/ml and -0.3 pg/ml, respectively) was maintained after the addition of rosuvastatin.Rosuvastatin+pioglitazone decreased tumor necrosis factor-α (-0.3 ng/ml) and were superior to glibenclamide+rosuvastatin in reducing high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (-0.4 mg/l).Pioglitazone decreased ultrasound parameters, and the addition of rosuvastatin further decreased them both compared with randomization and glibenclamide.

42;23991661;Dabigatran versus warfarin in patients with mechanical heart valves.;"Background. Dabigatran is an oral direct thrombin inhibitor that has been shown to be an effective alternative to warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation. We evaluated the use of dabigatran in patients with mechanical heart valves. Methods. In this phase 2 dose-validation study, we studied two populations of patients: those who had undergone aortic- or mitral-valve replacement within the past 7 days and those who had undergone such replacement at least 3 months earlier. Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either dabigatran or warfarin. The selection of the initial dabigatran dose (150, 220, or 300 mg twice daily) was based on kidney function. Doses were adjusted to obtain a trough plasma level of at least 50 ng per milliliter. The warfarin dose was adjusted to obtain an international normalized ratio of 2 to 3 or 2.5 to 3.5 on the basis of thromboembolic risk. The primary end point was the trough plasma level of dabigatran. Results. The trial was terminated prematurely after the enrollment of 252 patients because of an excess of thromboembolic and bleeding events among patients in the dabigatran group. In the as-treated analysis, dose adjustment or discontinuation of dabigatran was required in 52 of 162 patients (32%). Ischemic or unspecified stroke occurred in 9 patients (5%) in the dabigatran group and in no patients in the warfarin group; major bleeding occurred in 7 patients (4%) and 2 patients (2%), respectively. All patients with major bleeding had pericardial bleeding. Conclusions. The use of dabigatran in patients with mechanical heart valves was associated with increased rates of thromboembolic and bleeding complications, as compared with warfarin, thus showing no benefit and an excess risk.

This study sought to assess whether spironolactone treatment reduces the high incidence of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular (CCV) morbidity and mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Background. Aldosterone receptor blockers reduce cardiac-related events, but the efficacy of the agents in HD patients is unclear. Methods. A 3-year randomized trial involving 5 clinics was performed. Of the 309 oligoanuric HD patients enrolled in the study, 157 patients were randomly assigned to receive 25 mg/day of spironolactone without any restriction on dietary potassium intake (treatment group), and 152 patients were assigned to a control group. The primary outcome was a composite of death from CCV events or hospitalization for CCV events, and the secondary outcome was death from all causes. Results. During the 3-year follow-up, the primary outcome occurred in 5.7% of patients in the treatment group and in 12.5% of patients in the control group. Hazard ratios (HRs) for the primary outcome for treatment were 0.404 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.202 to 0.809; p = 0.017) and 0.379 (95% CI: 0.173 to 0.832; p = 0.016) before and after adjustment, respectively. The secondary outcome was significantly reduced in the treatment group compared with the control group (6.4% vs. 19.7%; HRs: 0.355 [95% CI: 0.191 to 0.662; p = 0.002] and 0.335 [95% CI: 0.162 to 0.693; p = 0.003] before and after adjustment, respectively). Gynecomastia or breast pain was reported in 16 patients (10.2%) in the treatment group. Serious hyperkalemia led to treatment discontinuation in 3 patients (1.9%). Conclusions. Aldosterone receptor blockade using spironolactone may substantially reduce the risk of both CCV morbidity and death among HD patients; however, larger-scale studies are recommended to further confirm its efficacy.

44;24240777;Effects of immediate blood pressure reduction on death and major disability in patients with acute ischemic stroke: the CATIS randomized clinical trial.;"Importance. Although the benefit of reducing blood pressure for primary and secondary prevention of stroke has been established, the effect of antihypertensive treatment in patients with acute ischemic stroke is uncertain. Objective. To evaluate whether immediate blood pressure reduction in patients with acute ischemic stroke would reduce death and major disability at 14 days or hospital discharge. Design, setting, and participants. The China Antihypertensive Trial in Acute Ischemic Stroke, a single-blind, blinded end-points randomized clinical trial, conducted among 4071 patients with nonthrombolysed ischemic stroke within 48 hours of onset and elevated systolic blood pressure. Patients were recruited from 26 hospitals across China between August 2009 and May 2013. Interventions. Patients (n = 2038) were randomly assigned to receive antihypertensive treatment (aimed at lowering systolic blood pressure by 10% to 25% within the first 24 hours after randomization, achieving blood pressure less than 140/90 mm Hg within 7 days, and maintaining this level during hospitalization) or to discontinue all antihypertensive medications (control) during hospitalization (n = 2033). Main outcomes and measures. Primary outcome was a combination of death and major disability (modified Rankin Scale score ≥3) at 14 days or hospital discharge. Results. Mean systolic blood pressure was reduced from 166.7 mm Hg to 144.7 mm Hg (-12.7%) within 24 hours in the antihypertensive treatment group and from 165.6 mm Hg to 152.9 mm Hg (-7.2%) in the control group within 24 hours after randomization (difference, -5.5% [95% CI, -4.9 to -6.1%]; absolute difference, -9.1 mm Hg [95% CI, -10.2 to -8.1]; P < .001). Mean systolic blood pressure was 137.3 mm Hg in the antihypertensive treatment group and 146.5 mm Hg in the control group at day 7 after randomization (difference, -9.3 mm Hg [95% CI, -10.1 to -8.4]; P < .001). The primary outcome did not differ between treatment groups (683 events [antihypertensive treatment] vs 681 events [control]; odds ratio, 1.00 [95% CI, 0.88 to 1.14]; P = .98) at 14 days or hospital discharge. The secondary composite outcome of death and major disability at 3-month posttreatment follow-up did not differ between treatment groups (500 events [antihypertensive treatment] vs 502 events [control]; odds ratio, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.86 to 1.15]; P = .93). Conclusion and relevance. Among patients with acute ischemic stroke, blood pressure reduction with antihypertensive medications, compared with the absence of hypertensive medication, did not reduce the likelihood of death and major disability at 14 days or hospital discharge.

45;24344086;Treatment of acute venous thromboembolism with dabigatran or warfarin and pooled analysis.;"Background. Dabigatran and warfarin have been compared for the treatment of acute venous thromboembolism (VTE) in a previous trial. We undertook this study to extend those findings. Methods and results. In a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy trial of 2589 patients with acute VTE treated with low-molecular-weight or unfractionated heparin for 5 to 11 days, we compared dabigatran 150 mg twice daily with warfarin. The primary outcome, recurrent symptomatic, objectively confirmed VTE and related deaths during 6 months of treatment occurred in 30 of the 1279 dabigatran patients (2.3%) compared with 28 of the 1289 warfarin patients (2.2%; hazard ratio, 1.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.64-1.80; absolute risk difference, 0.2%; 95% CI, -1.0 to 1.3; P<0.001 for the prespecified noninferiority margin for both criteria). The safety end point, major bleeding, occurred in 15 patients receiving dabigatran (1.2%) and in 22 receiving warfarin (1.7%; hazard ratio, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.36-1.32). Any bleeding occurred in 200 dabigatran (15.6%) and 285 warfarin (22.1%; hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.56-0.81) patients. Deaths, adverse events, and acute coronary syndromes were similar in both groups. Pooled analysis of this study RE-COVER II and the RE-COVER trial gave hazard ratios for recurrent VTE of 1.09 (95% CI, 0.76-1.57), for major bleeding of 0.73 (95% CI, 0.48-1.11), and for any bleeding of 0.70 (95% CI, 0.61-0.79). Conclusion. Dabigatran has similar effects on VTE recurrence and a lower risk of bleeding compared with warfarin for the treatment of acute VTE.

Methods Subjects were randomly assigned to either open-label lisinopril (n = 100) or atenolol (n = 100) each administered three times per week after dialysis. Monthly monitored home blood pressure (BP) was controlled to <140/90 mmHg with medications, dry weight adjustment and sodium restriction. The primary outcome was the change in left ventricular mass index (LVMI) from baseline to 12 months. Results At baseline, 44-h ambulatory BP was similar in the atenolol (151.5/87.1 mmHg) and lisinopril groups, and improved similarly over time in both groups. However, monthly measured home BP was consistently higher in the lisinopril group despite the need for both a greater number of antihypertensive agents and a greater reduction in dry weight. An independent data safety monitoring board recommended termination because of cardiovascular safety. Serious cardiovascular events in the atenolol group occurred in 16 subjects, who had 20 events, and in the lisinopril group in 28 subjects, who had 43 events {incidence rate ratio (IRR) 2.36 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.36-4.23, P = 0.001]}. Combined serious adverse events of myocardial infarction, stroke and hospitalization for heart failure or cardiovascular death in the atenolol group occurred in 10 subjects, who had 11 events and in the lisinopril group in 17 subjects, who had 23 events (IRR 2.29, P = 0.021). Hospitalizations for heart failure were worse in the lisinopril group (IRR 3.13, P = 0.021). All-cause hospitalizations were higher in the lisinopril group [IRR 1.61 (95% CI 1.18-2.19, P = 0.002)]. LVMI improved with time; no difference between drugs was noted. Conclusions Among maintenance dialysis patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy, atenolol-based antihypertensive therapy may be superior to lisinopril-based therapy in preventing cardiovascular morbidity and all-cause hospitalizations.

To evaluate the effect of long-term maximally intensive statin therapy on indices of coronary atheroma composition in a randomized trial, and how these changes relate to modifications of serum lipoproteins and systemic inflammation. Methods and results. The Study of coronary Atheroma by inTravascular Ultrasound: the effect of Rosuvastatin vs. atorvastatiN (SATURN) employed serial intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) measures of coronary atheroma in patients treated with rosuvastatin 40 mg or atorvastatin 80 mg daily for 24 months. Seventy-one patients underwent serial assessment of indices of plaque composition by spectral analysis of the radiofrequency IVUS signal. Changes in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C; -52 (-72, -33) mg/dL, P < 0.001], C-reactive protein [CRP -0.2 (-1, 0.1) mg/L, P = 0.01], and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C; +2.8 (-0.3, 7.8) mg/dL, P < 0.001] were associated with regression of percent atheroma volume (PAV: -1.6 ± 3.6%, P < 0.001). A reduction in estimated fibro-fatty tissue volume accompanied atheroma regression (P < 0.001), while dense calcium tissue volume increased (P = 0.002). There were no changes in fibrous or necrotic core tissue volumes. Volumetric changes in necrotic core tissue correlated with on-treatment HDL-C (r = -0.27, P = 0.03) and CRP (r = 0.25, P = 0.03) levels. A per-lesion analysis showed a reduction in the number of pathological intimal thickening lesions (defined by ≥3 consecutive IVUS frames containing PAV of ≥40%, predominantly fibro-fatty plaque, with <10% confluent necrotic core and <10% confluent dense calcium) at follow-up (67 vs. 38, P = 0.001). Fibroatheromas and fibrotic lesions remained static in number. Conclusions. Changes in indices of atheroma composition accompany regression of coronary atheroma with maximally intensive statin therapy, and associate with anti-inflammatory effects of statins.

48;24621834;Effect of levosimendan on the short-term clinical course of patients with acutely decompensated heart failure.;"Background. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of levosimendan, a positive inotropic drug with vasodilator effects, given intravenously to patients with acutely decompensated heart failure (ADHF). Methods. We performed 2 sequential trials, the first to develop a new measure of efficacy in 100 patients, and the second to use this measure to evaluate levosimendan in an additional 600 patients. Patients admitted with ADHF received placebo or intravenous levosimendan for 24 h in addition to standard treatment. The primary endpoint was a composite that evaluated changes in clinical status during the first 5 days after randomization. Results. In the 600-patient trial, more levosimendan than placebo patients (58 vs. 44) were improved at all 3 pre-specified time points (6 h, 24 h, and 5 days), whereas fewer levosimendan patients (58 vs. 82) experienced clinical worsening (p = 0.015 for the difference between the groups). These differences were apparent, despite more frequent intensification of adjunctive therapy in the placebo group (79 vs. 45 patients). Improvements in patient self-assessment and declines in B-type natriuretic peptide levels with levosimendan persisted for 5 days and were associated with reduced length of stay (p = 0.009). Similar findings were present in the 100-patient pilot trial. Levosimendan was associated with more frequent hypotension and cardiac arrhythmias during the infusion period and a numerically higher risk of death across the 2 trials (49 of 350 on a regimen of levosimendan vs. 40 of 350 on a regimen of placebo at 90 days, p = 0.29). Conclusions. In patients with ADHF, intravenous levosimendan provided rapid and durable symptomatic relief.

49;24678955;Darapladib for preventing ischemic events in stable coronary heart disease.;"Background. Elevated lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 activity promotes the development of vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques, and elevated plasma levels of this enzyme are associated with an increased risk of coronary events. Darapladib is a selective oral inhibitor of lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2. Methods. In a double-blind trial, we randomly assigned 15,828 patients with stable coronary heart disease to receive either once-daily darapladib (at a dose of 160 mg) or placebo. The primary end point was a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke. Secondary end points included the components of the primary end point as well as major coronary events (death from coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, or urgent coronary revascularization for myocardial ischemia) and total coronary events (death from coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, hospitalization for unstable angina, or any coronary revascularization). Results. During a median follow-up period of 3.7 years, the primary end point occurred in 769 of 7924 patients (9.7%) in the darapladib group and 819 of 7904 patients (10.4%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio in the darapladib group, 0.94; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.85 to 1.03; P=0.20). There were also no significant between-group differences in the rates of the individual components of the primary end point or in all-cause mortality. Darapladib, as compared with placebo, reduced the rate of major coronary events (9.3% vs. 10.3%; hazard ratio, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.82 to 1.00; P=0.045) and total coronary events (14.6% vs. 16.1%; hazard ratio, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.84 to 0.98; P=0.02).

Evolocumab, a monoclonal antibody that inhibits proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), significantly reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels in phase 2 studies. We conducted a phase 3 trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 52 weeks of treatment with evolocumab. Methods. We stratified patients with hyperlipidemia according to the risk categories outlined by the Adult Treatment Panel III of the National Cholesterol Education Program. On the basis of this classification, patients were started on background lipid-lowering therapy with diet alone or diet plus atorvastatin at a dose of 10 mg daily, atorvastatin at a dose of 80 mg daily, or atorvastatin at a dose of 80 mg daily plus ezetimibe at a dose of 10 mg daily, for a run-in period of 4 to 12 weeks. Patients with an LDL cholesterol level of 75 mg per deciliter (1.9 mmol per liter) or higher were then randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either evolocumab (420 mg) or placebo every 4 weeks. The primary end point was the percent change from baseline in LDL cholesterol, as measured by means of ultracentrifugation, at week 52. Results. Among the 901 patients included in the primary analysis, the overall least-squares mean (±SE) reduction in LDL cholesterol from baseline in the evolocumab group, taking into account the change in the placebo group, was 57.0±2.1% (P<0.001). The mean reduction was 55.7±4.2% among patients who underwent background therapy with diet alone, 61.6±2.6% among those who received 10 mg of atorvastatin, 56.8±5.3% among those who received 80 mg of atorvastatin, and 48.5±5.2% among those who received a combination of 80 mg of atorvastatin and 10 mg of ezetimibe (P<0.001 for all comparisons). Evolocumab treatment also significantly reduced levels of apolipoprotein B, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, lipoprotein(a), and triglycerides. The most common adverse events were nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, influenza, and back pain. Conclusions. At 52 weeks, evolocumab added to diet alone, to low-dose atorvastatin, or to high-dose atorvastatin with or without ezetimibe significantly reduced LDL cholesterol levels in patients with a range of cardiovascular risks.

Mineralocorticoid-receptor antagonists improve the prognosis for patients with heart failure and a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. We evaluated the effects of spironolactone in patients with heart failure and a preserved left ventricular ejection fraction. Methods. In this randomized, double-blind trial, we assigned 3445 patients with symptomatic heart failure and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 45% or more to receive either spironolactone (15 to 45 mg daily) or placebo. The primary outcome was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, aborted cardiac arrest, or hospitalization for the management of heart failure. Results. With a mean follow-up of 3.3 years, the primary outcome occurred in 320 of 1722 patients in the spironolactone group (18.6%) and 351 of 1723 patients in the placebo group (20.4%) (hazard ratio, 0.89; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.77 to 1.04; P=0.14). Of the components of the primary outcome, only hospitalization for heart failure had a significantly lower incidence in the spironolactone group than in the placebo group (206 patients [12.0%] vs. 245 patients [14.2%]; hazard ratio, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.69 to 0.99, P=0.04). Neither total deaths nor hospitalizations for any reason were significantly reduced by spironolactone. Treatment with spironolactone was associated with increased serum creatinine levels and a doubling of the rate of hyperkalemia (18.7%, vs. 9.1% in the placebo group) but reduced hypokalemia. With frequent monitoring, there were no significant differences in the incidence of serious adverse events, a serum creatinine level of 3.0 mg per deciliter (265 μmol per liter) or higher, or dialysis.

52;24739593;A comparative study of dual versus monoantiplatelet therapy in patients with acute large-artery atherosclerosis stroke.;Background. Antiplatelet drugs are recommended for patients with acute noncardioembolic stroke. However, few randomized clinical trials have investigated the safety and efficacy of dual antiplatelet therapy for these patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of treatment with clopidogrel and aspirin (combination therapy) and aspirin alone (monotherapy) on neurologic deterioration, platelet activation, and other short-term outcomes in patients with acute large-artery atherosclerosis stroke. Materials and methods. Altogether 574 patients with acute (≤2 days) large-artery atherosclerosis stroke were randomly assigned to receive either combined clopidogrel and aspirin or aspirin alone. Platelet aggregation and platelet-leukocyte aggregation studies were performed at days 1 and 30. Primary outcomes including recurrent ischemic stroke, neurologic deterioration, periphery vascular events, and myocardial infarction were monitored. Safety endpoints were hemorrhagic episodes and death. Results. The prevalence of neurologic deterioration and recurrent ischemic stroke were lower in patients in the combination therapy group than in those of the monotherapy group (3.52% versus 9.78% and 1.76% versus 6.29%, respectively). At day 30 of treatment, the platelet aggregations and platelet-leukocyte aggregates were lower in patients who were treated with clopidogrel and aspirin than in patients given aspirin alone (P < .001). Conclusions. For patients with acute large-artery atherosclerosis stroke, treatment with clopidogrel and aspirin for 1 month provided significantly greater inhibition of platelet activity than aspirin alone. Thus, dual therapy can be safer and more effective in reducing ischemic stroke recurrence and neurologic deterioration.;Circulatory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train

We compared the angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor LCZ696 with enalapril in patients who had heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction. In previous studies, enalapril improved survival in such patients. Methods. In this double-blind trial, we randomly assigned 8442 patients with class II, III, or IV heart failure and an ejection fraction of 40% or less to receive either LCZ696 (at a dose of 200 mg twice daily) or enalapril (at a dose of 10 mg twice daily), in addition to recommended therapy. The primary outcome was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes or hospitalization for heart failure, but the trial was designed to detect a difference in the rates of death from cardiovascular causes. Results. The trial was stopped early, according to prespecified rules, after a median follow-up of 27 months, because the boundary for an overwhelming benefit with LCZ696 had been crossed. At the time of study closure, the primary outcome had occurred in 914 patients (21.8%) in the LCZ696 group and 1117 patients (26.5%) in the enalapril group (hazard ratio in the LCZ696 group, 0.80; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.73 to 0.87; P<0.001). A total of 711 patients (17.0%) receiving LCZ696 and 835 patients (19.8%) receiving enalapril died (hazard ratio for death from any cause, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.76 to 0.93; P<0.001); of these patients, 558 (13.3%) and 693 (16.5%), respectively, died from cardiovascular causes (hazard ratio, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.71 to 0.89; P<0.001). As compared with enalapril, LCZ696 also reduced the risk of hospitalization for heart failure by 21% (P<0.001) and decreased the symptoms and physical limitations of heart failure (P=0.001). The LCZ696 group had higher proportions of patients with hypotension and nonserious angioedema but lower proportions with renal impairment, hyperkalemia, and cough than the enalapril group.

We evaluated safety, feasibility and tolerability of intravenous dantrolene (IV-D) in patients with aSAH. Methods. In this single-centre, randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled trial, 31 patients with aSAH were randomised to IV-D 1.25 mg every 6 h for 7 days (n=16) or equiosmolar free water/5% mannitol (placebo; n=15). Primary safety end points were incidence of hyponatraemia (sNa≤132 mmol/L) and liver toxicity (proportion of patients alanine transaminase, aspartate aminotransferase and AlkPhos >5× upper-limit-of-normal). Secondary end points included tolerability, systemic hypotension and intracranial hypertension. Efficacy was explored for clinical/radiological cVSP, delayed cerebral ischaemia (DCI), and 3-month functional outcomes. Quantitative analyses of angiograms and daily transcranial Doppler (TCD) were performed. Results. Between IV-D versus placebo, no differences were observed in the primary outcomes (hyponatremia 44% vs 67% (p=0.29); liver toxicity 6% vs 0% (p=1.0)). Three patients in the IV-D versus two in the placebo group had severe adverse events possibly attributable to infusion and reached stop criteria: one IV-D patient developed liver toxicity; two patients in each group developed brain oedema requiring osmotherapy. The majority of adverse events were not related to infusion (17 vs 5 (RR 2.2; 95% CI 0.7 to 6.7; p=0.16) in IV-D vs placebo). No differences in any categorical cVSP outcomes, DCI, 3-month outcomes or quantitative angiogram and TCD analyses were seen in this small safety trial not powered to detect efficacy. Conclusions. In this small trial, IV-D after aSAH was feasible, tolerable and safe. Trial registration number. http://clinicaltrials.gov NCT01024972.";Circulatory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train
55;25432415;Effects of niacin, statin, and fenofibrate on circulating proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 levels in patients with dyslipidemia.;"Recent trials demonstrated substantial improvement in lipid parameters with inhibition of proprotein convertase subtilisin-like/kexin type 9 (PCSK9). Although statins and fibrates have been reported to increase plasma PCSK9 levels, the effect of niacin on PCSK9 is unknown. We investigated the impact of niacin, atorvastatin, and fenofibrate on PCSK9 levels in 3 distinct studies. A statin-only study randomized 74 hypercholesterolemic patients to placebo, atorvastatin 10 mg/day, or atorvastatin 80 mg/day for 16 weeks. A dose-related increase in PCSK9 was noted such that atorvastatin 80 mg increased PCSK9 by a mean +27% (95% confidence interval [CI] +12 to +42), confirming the effect of statin therapy on raising PCSK9. A second study randomized 70 patients with carotid atherosclerosis to simvastatin 20 mg/day, simvastatin 80 mg/day, or simvastatin 20 mg/extended-release (ER) niacin 2 g/day. PCSK9 levels were increased with statin therapy, but decreased with the simvastatin 20 mg/ER niacin combination (mean -13%, CI -3 to -23). A final study involved 19 dyslipidemic participants on atorvastatin 10 mg with serial addition of fenofibric acid 135 mg followed by ER niacin 2 g/day. Fenofibric acid led to a +23% (CI +10 to +36, p = 0.001) increase in PCSK9; the addition of niacin resulted in a subsequent -17% decrease (CI -19 to -5, p = 0.004). A positive association was noted between change in PCSK9 and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (r = 0.62, p = 0.006) with the addition of niacin. In conclusion, niacin therapy offsets the increase in PCSK9 levels noted with statin and fibrate therapy. A portion of the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction seen with niacin therapy may be due to reduction in PCSK9.";Circulatory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train
56;25455006;Stroke outcomes among participants randomized to chlorthalidone, amlodipine or lisinopril in ALLHAT.;The Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) was a randomized, double-blind, practice-based, active-control, comparative effectiveness trial in 33,357 high-risk hypertensive participants. ALLHAT compared cardiovascular disease outcomes in participants initially treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (lisinopril), a calcium channel blocker (amlodipine), or a thiazide-type diuretic (chlorthalidone). We report stroke outcomes in 1517 participants in-trial and 1596 additional participants during post-trial passive surveillance, for a total follow-up of 8-13 years. Stroke rates were higher with lisinopril (6-year rate/100 = 6.4) than with chlorthalidone (5.8) or amlodipine (5.5) in-trial but not including post-trial (10-year rates/100 = 13.2 [chlorthalidone], 13.1[amlodipine], and 13.7 [lisinopril]). In-trial differences were driven by race (race-by-lisinopril/chlorthalidone interaction P = .005, race-by-amlodipine/lisinopril interaction P = .012) and gender (gender-by-lisinopril/amlodipine interaction P = .041), separately. No treatment differences overall, or by race or gender, were detected over the 10-year period. No differences appeared among treatment groups in adjusted risk of all-cause mortality including post-trial for participants with nonfatal in-trial strokes. Among Blacks and women, lisinopril was less effective in preventing stroke in-trial than either chlorthalidone or amlodipine, even after adjusting for differences in systolic blood pressure. These differences abated by the end of the post-trial period.;Circulatory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train
57;25801871;Effects of vitamin D on blood pressure and cardiovascular risk factors: a randomized controlled trial.;"Unlabelled Vitamin D deficiency is a risk factor for arterial hypertension, but randomized controlled trials showed mixed effects of vitamin D supplementation on blood pressure (BP). We aimed to evaluate whether vitamin D supplementation affects 24-hour systolic ambulatory BP monitoring values and cardiovascular risk factors. The Styrian Vitamin D Hypertension Trial is a single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted from June 2011 to August 2014 at the endocrine outpatient clinic of the Medical University of Graz, Austria. We enrolled 200 study participants with arterial hypertension and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels below 30 ng/mL. Study participants were randomized to receive either 2800 IU of vitamin D3 per day as oily drops (n=100) or placebo (n=100) for 8 weeks. Primary outcome measure was 24-hour systolic BP. Secondary outcome measures were 24-hour diastolic BP, N-terminal-pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, QTc interval, renin, aldosterone, 24-hour urinary albumin excretion, homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and pulse wave velocity. A total of 188 participants (mean [SD] age, 60.1 [11.3] years; 47% women; 25-hydroxyvitamin D, 21.2 [5.6] ng/mL) completed the trial. The mean treatment effect (95% confidence interval) for 24-hour systolic BP was -0.4 (-2.8 to 1.9) mm Hg (P=0.712). Triglycerides increased significantly (mean change [95% confidence interval], 17 [1-33] mg/dL; P=0.013), but no further significant effects were observed for secondary outcomes. Vitamin D supplementation in hypertensive patients with low 25-hydroxyvitamin D has no significant effect on BP and several cardiovascular risk factors, but it was associated with a significant increase in triglycerides.

58;25926562;Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cell treatment in patients with severe ischaemic heart failure: a randomized placebo-controlled trial (MSC-HF trial).;Aims. Regenerative treatment with mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) has been promising in patients with ischaemic heart failure but needs confirmation in larger randomized trials. We aimed to study effects of intra-myocardial autologous bone marrow-derived MSC treatment in patients with severe ischaemic heart failure. Methods and results. The MSC-HF trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Patients were randomized 2 : 1 to intra-myocardial injections of MSC or placebo, respectively. The primary endpoint was change in left ventricular end-systolic volume (LVESV), measured by magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography at 6 months follow-up. Sixty patients aged 30-80 years with severe ischaemic heart failure, New York Heart Association (NYHA) classes II-III, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <45% and no further treatment options were randomized. Fifty-five patients completed the 6-month follow-up (37 MSCs vs. 18 placebo). At 6 months, LVESV was reduced in the MSC group: -7.6 (95% CI -11.8 to -3.4) mL (P = 0.001), and increased in the placebo group: 5.4 (95% CI -0.4 to 11.2) mL (P = 0.07). The difference between groups was 13.0 (95% CI 5.9-20.1) mL (P = 0.001). Compared with placebo, there were also significant improvements in LVEF of 6.2% (P<0.0001), stroke volume of 18.4 mL (P < 0.0001), and myocardial mass of 5.7 g (P = 0.001). No differences were found in NYHA class, 6-min walking test and Kansas City cardiomyopathy questionnaire. No side effects were identified. Conclusion. Intra-myocardial injections of autologous culture expanded MSCs were safe and improved myocardial function in patients with severe ischaemic heart failure. Study registration number.

59;25957224;Clopidogrel With Aspirin in Acute Minor Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (CHANCE) Trial: One-Year Outcomes.;"Background. The Clopidogrel in High-risk patients with Acute Non-disabling Cerebrovascular Events (CHANCE) trial showed that the combined treatment of clopidogrel and aspirin decreases the 90-day risk of stroke without increasing hemorrhage in comparison with aspirin alone, but provided insufficient data to establish whether the benefit persisted over a longer period of time beyond the trial termination. We report the 1-year follow-up outcomes of this trial. Methods and results. The trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted at 114 centers in China. We randomly assigned 5170 patients within 24 hours after onset of minor stroke or high-risk transient ischemic attack to clopidogrel-aspirin therapy (loading dose of 300 mg of clopidogrel on day 1, followed by 75 mg of clopidogrel per day for 90 days, plus 75 mg of aspirin per day for the first 21 days) or to the aspirin-alone group (75 mg/d for 90 days). The primary outcome was stroke event (ischemic or hemorrhagic) during 1-year follow-up. Differences in outcomes between groups were assessed by using the Cox proportional hazards model. Stroke occurred in 275 (10.6%) patients in the clopidogrel-aspirin group, in comparison with 362 (14.0%) patients in the aspirin group (hazard ratio, 0.78; 95% confidence interval, 0.65-0.93; P=0.006). Moderate or severe hemorrhage occurred in 7 (0.3%) patients in the clopidogrel-aspirin group and in 9 (0.4%) patients in the aspirin group (P=0.44). Conclusions. The early benefit of clopidogrel-aspirin treatment in reducing the risk of subsequent stroke persisted for the duration of 1-year of follow-up. Clinical trial registration.

60;26039521;Ezetimibe Added to Statin Therapy after Acute Coronary Syndromes.;"Background. Statin therapy reduces low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels and the risk of cardiovascular events, but whether the addition of ezetimibe, a nonstatin drug that reduces intestinal cholesterol absorption, can reduce the rate of cardiovascular events further is not known. Methods. We conducted a double-blind, randomized trial involving 18,144 patients who had been hospitalized for an acute coronary syndrome within the preceding 10 days and had LDL cholesterol levels of 50 to 100 mg per deciliter (1.3 to 2.6 mmol per liter) if they were receiving lipid-lowering therapy or 50 to 125 mg per deciliter (1.3 to 3.2 mmol per liter) if they were not receiving lipid-lowering therapy. The combination of simvastatin (40 mg) and ezetimibe (10 mg) (simvastatin-ezetimibe) was compared with simvastatin (40 mg) and placebo (simvastatin monotherapy). The primary end point was a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, unstable angina requiring rehospitalization, coronary revascularization (≥30 days after randomization), or nonfatal stroke. The median follow-up was 6 years. Results. The median time-weighted average LDL cholesterol level during the study was 53.7 mg per deciliter (1.4 mmol per liter) in the simvastatin-ezetimibe group, as compared with 69.5 mg per deciliter (1.8 mmol per liter) in the simvastatin-monotherapy group (P<0.001). The Kaplan-Meier event rate for the primary end point at 7 years was 32.7% in the simvastatin-ezetimibe group, as compared with 34.7% in the simvastatin-monotherapy group (absolute risk difference, 2.0 percentage points; hazard ratio, 0.936; 95% confidence interval, 0.89 to 0.99; P=0.016). Rates of prespecified muscle, gallbladder, and hepatic adverse effects and cancer were similar in the two groups. Conclusions. When added to statin therapy, ezetimibe resulted in incremental lowering of LDL cholesterol levels and improved cardiovascular outcomes. Moreover, lowering LDL cholesterol to levels below previous targets provided additional benefit.

61;26227186;Impact of Dual Lipid-Lowering Strategy With Ezetimibe and Atorvastatin on Coronary Plaque Regression in Patients With Percutaneous Coronary Intervention: The Multicenter Randomized Controlled PRECISE-IVUS Trial.;"Background. Despite standard statin therapy, a majority of patients retain a high ""residual risk"" of cardiovascular events. Objectives. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of ezetimibe plus atorvastatin versus atorvastatin monotherapy on the lipid profile and coronary atherosclerosis in Japanese patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Methods. This trial was a prospective, randomized, controlled, multicenter study. Eligible patients who underwent PCI were randomly assigned to atorvastatin alone or atorvastatin plus ezetimibe (10 mg) daily. Atorvastatin was uptitrated with a treatment goal of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) <70 mg/dl. Serial volumetric intravascular ultrasound was performed at baseline and again at 9 to 12 months to quantify the coronary plaque response in 202 patients. Results. The combination of atorvastatin/ezetimibe resulted in lower levels of LDL-C than atorvastatin monotherapy (63.2 ± 16.3 mg/dl vs. 73.3 ± 20.3 mg/dl; p < 0.001). For the absolute change in percent atheroma volume (PAV), the mean difference between the 2 groups (-1.538%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -3.079% to 0.003%) did not exceed the pre-defined noninferiority margin of 3%, but the absolute change in PAV did show superiority for the dual lipid-lowering strategy (-1.4%; 95% CI: -3.4% to -0.1% vs. -0.3%; 95% CI: -1.9% to 0.9% with atorvastatin alone; p = 0.001). For PAV, a significantly greater percentage of patients who received atorvastatin/ezetimibe showed coronary plaque regression (78% vs. 58%; p = 0.004). Both strategies had acceptable side effect profiles, with a low incidence of laboratory abnormalities and cardiovascular events. Conclusions. Compared with standard statin monotherapy, the combination of statin plus ezetimibe showed greater coronary plaque regression, which might be attributed to cholesterol absorption inhibition-induced aggressive lipid lowering.

One hundred and forty-four patients were randomized to lercanidipine, 20 mg/day, or barnidipine, 20 mg/day, in addition to losartan, 100 mg/day, for 6 months. We evaluated: blood pressure, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), glycated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)), lipid profile, creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), sodium, potassium, and acid uric. Echocardiography was performed at baseline and after 6 months. Both lercanidipine and barnidipine decreased blood pressure. Left ventricular mass index was reduced to a greater extent with barnidipine + losartan. Interventricular septal thickness in diastole was reduced by barnidipine + losartan. Posterior wall thickness in diastole was decreased by both treatments, even if barnidipine + losartan were more effective. Ratio of peak early diastolic filling velocity to peak filling velocity at atrial contraction was increased by barnidipine + losartan, but not by lercanidipine + losartan. Finally, isovolumetric relaxation and time and left atrial volume index were reduced by barnidipine + losartan, while lercanidipine + losartan did not affect them. In conclusion, barnidipine + losartan provided a greater improvement of echocardiographic parameters compared to lercanidipine + losartan.;Circulatory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train
63;26424461;Effects of statin therapy on coronary artery plaque volume and high-risk plaque morphology in HIV-infected patients with subclinical atherosclerosis: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.;"Background. HIV-infected patients have a high risk of myocardial infarction. We aimed to assess the ability of statin treatment to reduce arterial inflammation and achieve regression of coronary atherosclerosis in this population. Methods. In a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 40 HIV-infected participants with subclinical coronary atherosclerosis, evidence of arterial inflammation in the aorta by fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET, and LDL-cholesterol concentration of less than 3.37 mmol/L (130 mg/dL) were randomly assigned (1:1) to 1 year of treatment with atorvastatin or placebo. Randomisation was by the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Clinical Research Pharmacy with a permuted-block algorithm, stratified by sex with a fixed block size of four. Study codes were available only to the MGH Research Pharmacy and not to study investigators or participants. The prespecified primary endpoint was arterial inflammation as assessed by FDG-PET of the aorta. Additional prespecified endpoints were non-calcified and calcified plaque measures and high risk plaque features assessed with coronary CT angiography and biochemical measures. Analysis was done by intention to treat with all available data and without imputation for missing data. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00965185. Findings. The study was done from Nov 13, 2009, to Jan 13, 2014. 19 patients were assigned to atorvastatin and 21 to placebo. 37 (93%) of 40 participants completed the study, with equivalent discontinuation rates in both groups. Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. After 12 months, change in FDG-PET uptake of the most diseased segment of the aorta was not different between atorvastatin and placebo, but technically adequate results comparing longitudinal changes in identical regions could be assessed in only 21 patients (atorvastatin Δ -0.03, 95% CI -0.17 to 0.12, vs placebo Δ -0.06, -0.25 to 0.13; p=0.77). Change in plaque could be assessed in all 37 people completing the study. Atorvastatin reduced non-calcified coronary plaque volume relative to placebo: median change -19.4% (IQR -39.2 to 9.3) versus 20.4% (-7.1 to 94.4; p=0.009, n=37). The number of high-risk plaques was significantly reduced in the atorvastatin group compared with the placebo group: change in number of low attenuation plaques -0.2 (95% CI -0.6 to 0.2) versus 0.4 (0.0, 0.7; p=0.03; n=37); and change in number of positively remodelled plaques -0.2 (-0.4 to 0.1) versus 0.4 (-0.1 to 0.8; p=0.04; n=37). Direct LDL-cholesterol (-1.00 mmol/L, 95% CI -1.38 to 0.61 vs 0.30 mmol/L, 0.04 to 0.55, p<0.0001) and lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (-52.2 ng/mL, 95% CI -70.4 to -34.0, vs -13.3 ng/mL, -32.8 to 6.2; p=0.005; n=37) decreased significantly with atorvastatin relative to placebo. Statin therapy was well tolerated, with a low incidence of clinical adverse events. Interpretation. No significant effects of statin therapy on arterial inflammation of the aorta were seen as measured by FDG-PET. However, statin therapy reduced non-calcified plaque volume and high-risk coronary plaque features in HIV-infected patients. Further studies should assess whether reduction in high-risk coronary artery disease translates into effective prevention of cardiovascular events in this at-risk population. Funding.

64;26549714;Isosorbide Mononitrate in Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction.;"Background. Nitrates are commonly prescribed to enhance activity tolerance in patients with heart failure and a preserved ejection fraction. We compared the effect of isosorbide mononitrate or placebo on daily activity in such patients. Methods. In this multicenter, double-blind, crossover study, 110 patients with heart failure and a preserved ejection fraction were randomly assigned to a 6-week dose-escalation regimen of isosorbide mononitrate (from 30 mg to 60 mg to 120 mg once daily) or placebo, with subsequent crossover to the other group for 6 weeks. The primary end point was the daily activity level, quantified as the average daily accelerometer units during the 120-mg phase, as assessed by patient-worn accelerometers. Secondary end points included hours of activity per day during the 120-mg phase, daily accelerometer units during all three dose regimens, quality-of-life scores, 6-minute walk distance, and levels of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP). Results. In the group receiving the 120-mg dose of isosorbide mononitrate, as compared with the placebo group, there was a nonsignificant trend toward lower daily activity (-381 accelerometer units; 95% confidence interval [CI], -780 to 17; P=0.06) and a significant decrease in hours of activity per day (-0.30 hours; 95% CI, -0.55 to -0.05; P=0.02). During all dose regimens, activity in the isosorbide mononitrate group was lower than that in the placebo group (-439 accelerometer units; 95% CI, -792 to -86; P=0.02). Activity levels decreased progressively and significantly with increased doses of isosorbide mononitrate (but not placebo). There were no significant between-group differences in the 6-minute walk distance, quality-of-life scores, or NT-proBNP levels. Conclusions. Patients with heart failure and a preserved ejection fraction who received isosorbide mononitrate were less active and did not have better quality of life or submaximal exercise capacity than did patients who received placebo.

To compare lipid-lowering efficacy of adding alirocumab to rosuvastatin versus other treatment strategies (NCT01730053). Methods. Patients receiving baseline rosuvastatin regimens (10 or 20 mg) were randomized to: add-on alirocumab 75 mg every-2-weeks (Q2W) (1-mL subcutaneous injection via pre-filled pen); add-on ezetimibe 10 mg/day; or double-dose rosuvastatin. Patients had cardiovascular disease (CVD) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) ≥70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) or CVD risk factors and LDL-C ≥100 mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L). In the alirocumab group, dose was blindly increased at Week 12 to 150 mg Q2W (also 1-mL volume) in patients not achieving their LDL-C target. Primary endpoint was percent change in calculated LDL-C from baseline to 24 weeks (intent-to-treat). Results. 305 patients were randomized. In the baseline rosuvastatin 10 mg group, significantly greater LDL-C reductions were observed with add-on alirocumab (-50.6%) versus ezetimibe (-14.4%; p < 0.0001) and double-dose rosuvastatin (-16.3%; p < 0.0001). In the baseline rosuvastatin 20 mg group, LDL-C reduction with add-on alirocumab was -36.3% compared with -11.0% with ezetimibe and -15.9% with double-dose rosuvastatin (p = 0.0136 and 0.0453, respectively; pre-specified threshold for significance p < 0.0125). Overall, ∼80% alirocumab patients were maintained on 75 mg Q2W. Of alirocumab-treated patients, 84.9% and 66.7% in the baseline rosuvastatin 10 and 20 mg groups, respectively, achieved risk-based LDL-C targets. Treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 56.3% of alirocumab patients versus 53.5% ezetimibe and 67.3% double-dose rosuvastatin (pooled data). Conclusions.

66;26657609;Effects of epinephrine over P wave duration and ventricular repolarization in subjects without structural heart disease.;Background. Little is known about the effects of epinephrine over atrial electrical function, AV conduction and ventricular repolarization in normal subjects. We intended to study the effects of intravenous epinephrine on the duration of P wave, inter-atrial conduction time, PR, QRS, QT, corrected QT (QTc), QTc dispersion (QTc max-min), the peak-to-end interval of T wave (Tp-e), the Tp-e/QT index, and the middle portion of ventricular repolarization length (QT-(QRS+Tp-e)) in healthy subjects. Methods. Forty-three, 37.20 ± 17.05 year-old, 25 (58%) female patients without structural heart disease took part in the study. They underwent an electrophysiological study. An epinephrine infusion (50 to 100 ng/kg/min) was administered for 5 min until an increase of at least 10% of the initial heart rate (HR) was achieved. Results. No complication arose from epinephrine infusion, and the drug facilitated arrhythmia induction. A significant increase in heart rate, systolic blood pressure, QRS, QTc, Tp-e, Tp-e/QT index, and QTc max-min interval duration was documented. No significant effect on diastolic blood pressure, P wave duration, inter-atrial conduction time, and PR, QT and QT-(Tp-e+QRS interval) was observed. Conclusions. In this group of patients without structural heart disease, epinephrine infusion did not produce any complication and it facilitated arrhythmia induction. It did not modify P wave duration, PR interval or inter-atrial conduction time. Moreover, it significantly increased the duration of depolarization, the final portion of repolarization, transmural dispersion of repolarization, and regional dispersion of repolarization without inducing significant changes in the middle portion of repolarization.;Circulatory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train

Stroke can be a life-threatening complication of atrial fibrillation (AF) catheter ablation. Uninterrupted warfarin treatment contributes to minimizing the risk of stroke complications. Methods and results. This was a prospective, open-label, randomized, multicenter study assessing the safety and efficacy of apixaban for the prevention of cerebral thromboembolism complicating AF catheter ablation. Two hundred patients with drug-resistant AF were equally assigned to take either apixaban (5 mg or 2.5 mg twice daily) or warfarin (target international normalized ratio, 2-3) for at least 1 month before AF ablation. Neither drug regimen was interrupted throughout the operative period. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging was performed for all patients to detect silent cerebral infarction (SCI) after the ablation. Primary outcomes were defined as the occurrence of stroke, transient ischemic attack, SCI, or major bleeding that required intervention. The secondary outcome was minor bleeding. The groups did not statistically differ in patients' backgrounds or procedural parameters. During AF ablation, the apixaban group required administration of more heparin to maintain an activated clotting time > 300 seconds than the warfarin group (apixaban, 14,000 ± 4,000 units; warfarin, 9,000 ± 3,000 units). Three primary outcome events occurred in each group (apixaban, 2 SCI and 1 major bleed; warfarin, 3 SCI, P = 1.00), and 3 and 4 secondary outcome events occurred in the apixaban and warfarin groups (P = 0.70), respectively. Conclusion. Apixaban has similar safety and effectiveness to warfarin for the prevention of cerebral thromboembolism during the periprocedural period of AF ablation.";Circulatory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train

Design, setting, and participants Two-stage randomized clinical trial including 511 adult patients with uncontrolled low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and history of intolerance to 2 or more statins enrolled in 2013 and 2014 globally. Phase A used a 24-week crossover procedure with atorvastatin or placebo to identify patients having symptoms only with atorvastatin but not placebo. In phase B, after a 2-week washout, patients were randomized to ezetimibe or evolocumab for 24 weeks. Interventions Phase A: atorvastatin (20 mg) vs placebo. Phase B: randomization 2:1 to subcutaneous evolocumab (420 mg monthly) or oral ezetimibe (10 mg daily). Main outcome and measures Coprimary end points were the mean percent change in LDL-C level from baseline to the mean of weeks 22 and 24 levels and from baseline to week 24 levels. Results Of the 491 patients who entered phase A (mean age, 60.7 [SD, 10.2] years; 246 women [50.1%]; 170 with coronary heart disease [34.6%]; entry mean LDL-C level, 212.3 [SD, 67.9] mg/dL), muscle symptoms occurred in 209 of 491 (42.6%) while taking atorvastatin but not while taking placebo. Of these, 199 entered phase B, along with 19 who proceeded directly to phase B for elevated creatine kinase (N = 218, with 73 randomized to ezetimibe and 145 to evolocumab; entry mean LDL-C level, 219.9 [SD, 72] mg/dL). For the mean of weeks 22 and 24, LDL-C level with ezetimibe was 183.0 mg/dL; mean percent LDL-C change, -16.7% (95% CI, -20.5% to -12.9%), absolute change, -31.0 mg/dL and with evolocumab was 103.6 mg/dL; mean percent change, -54.5% (95% CI, -57.2% to -51.8%); absolute change, -106.8 mg/dL (P < .001). LDL-C level at week 24 with ezetimibe was 181.5 mg/dL; mean percent change, -16.7% (95% CI, -20.8% to -12.5%); absolute change, -31.2 mg/dL and with evolocumab was 104.1 mg/dL; mean percent change, -52.8% (95% CI, -55.8% to -49.8%); absolute change, -102.9 mg/dL (P < .001). For the mean of weeks 22 and 24, between-group difference in LDL-C was -37.8%; absolute difference, -75.8 mg/dL. For week 24, between-group difference in LDL-C was -36.1%; absolute difference, -71.7 mg/dL. Muscle symptoms were reported in 28.8% of ezetimibe-treated patients and 20.7% of evolocumab-treated patients (log-rank P = .17). Active study drug was stopped for muscle symptoms in 5 of 73 ezetimibe-treated patients (6.8%) and 1 of 145 evolocumab-treated patients (0.7%). Conclusions and relevance Among patients with statin intolerance related to muscle-related adverse effects, the use of evolocumab compared with ezetimibe resulted in a significantly greater reduction in LDL-C levels after 24 weeks. Further studies are needed to assess long-term efficacy and safety. Trial registration clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01984424.";Circulatory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train
69;27131642;Efficacy and safety of the cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitor anacetrapib in Japanese patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.;"Background and aims. This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study assessed the lipid-modifying efficacy/safety profile of anacetrapib 100 mg added to ongoing statin ± other lipid-modifying therapies (LMT) in Japanese patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH). Methods. Patients 18-80 years with a genotype-confirmed/clinical diagnosis of HeFH who were on a stable dose of statin ± other LMT for ≥6 weeks and with an LDL-C concentration ≥100 mg/dL were randomized to anacetrapib 100 mg (n = 34) or placebo (n = 34) for 12 weeks, followed by a 12-week off-drug reversal phase. The primary endpoints were percent change from baseline in LDL-C (beta-quantification method [BQ]) and safety/tolerability. Results. At Week 12, treatment with anacetrapib reduced LDL-C (BQ) compared to placebo and resulting in a between-group difference of 29.8% (95% CI: -38.6 to -21.0; p < 0.001) favoring anacetrapib. Anacetrapib also reduced non-HDL-C (23. 6%; p < 0.001), ApoB (14.1%; p < 0.001) and Lp(a) (48.7%; p < 0.001), and increased HDL-C (110.0%; p < 0.001) and ApoA1 (48.2%; p < 0.001) versus placebo. Anacetrapib 100 mg added to ongoing therapy with statin ± other LMT for 12 weeks was generally well-tolerated. There were no differences between the groups in the proportion of patients who discontinued drug due to an adverse event or abnormalities in liver enzymes, creatinine kinase, blood pressure, electrolytes or adjudicated cardiovascular events. Conclusions. In Japanese patients with HeFH, treatment with anacetrapib 100 mg for 12 weeks resulted in substantial reductions in LDL-C and increases in HDL-C and was well tolerated.

70;27534738;Comparison of bisoprolol to a metoprolol CR/ZOK tablet for control of heart rate and blood pressure in mild-to-moderate hypertensive patients: the CREATIVE study.;"This open-label study investigated the long action of bisoprolol compared with metoprolol CR/ZOK for controlling the mean dynamic heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) in patients with mild-to-moderate primary hypertension. Patients from seven centers in China were treated with either bisoprolol 5 mg or metoprolol CR/ZOK 47.5 mg once daily for 12 weeks. The primary end points were the mean dynamic HR reduction and the mean dynamic diastolic BP (DBP) control in the last 4 h of the treatment period. Secondary end points included ambulatory monitoring of the BP and HR, safety and compliance. A total of 186 patients, with 93 patients in each group, were enrolled and analyzed. In the last 4 h of the treatment period, patients receiving bisoprolol demonstrated a significantly greater reduction in the mean dynamic HR compared with patients receiving metoprolol CR/ZOK (least squares means (LSmeans) of difference: -3.79 b.p.m.; 97.5% confidence interval (CI): -7.45, -0.14; P=0.0202). Furthermore, in the last 4 h of the treatment period, bisoprolol demonstrated non-inferiority vs. metoprolol CR/ZOK in lowering the mean dynamic DBP (LSmeans of difference: -1.00; 97.5% CI: -4.79, 2.78; P=0.5495). Bisoprolol further significantly lowered the 24-h mean ambulatory, mean daytime and mean nighttime HR. The overall adverse event rate was similar between the two groups. Noncompliance was reported in 3 (3.53%) and 6 (7.32%) patients in the bisoprolol and metoprolol CR/ZOK groups, respectively. In conclusion, bisoprolol provided superior dynamic HR reduction and non-inferior dynamic BP reduction vs. metoprolol CR/ZOK in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension.

71;27561415;Effect of Vitamin D and calcium supplementation on ischaemic stroke outcome: a randomised controlled open-label trial.;"Background and aims. Vitamin D deficiency is a common problem in stroke survivors. Observational studies have reported an association of low vitamin D levels with greater stroke severity, poststroke mortality and functional disability. Randomised clinical trials are lacking. We sought to assess the effect of calcium and vitamin D supplementation in ischaemic stroke survivors with vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency on disability/mortality outcomes. Methods. In this randomised controlled open-label trial, 73 patients of acute ischaemic stroke were screened for serum 25 hydroxy Vitamin D (25(OH)D) levels. A total of 53 patients with baseline 25(OH)D <75 nmol/L were randomised into two arms. One received vitamin D and calcium supplementation along with usual care (n=25) and the other received usual care alone (n=28). Primary outcome was the proportion of patients achieving a good outcome [modified Rankin Scale score 0-2] at 6 months and all cause mortality at 6 months. Results. The age (mean±SD) of participants was 60.4±11.3 years, 69.8% were males. The proportion of patients achieving good outcome was higher in the intervention arm (Adjusted OR 1.9, 95% CI 0.6-6.4; P=.31). The survival probability was greater in the intervention arm (83.8%, CI 62.4-93.6) as compared with the control arm (59.5%, CI 38.8-75.2; P=.049) with adjusted Hazard ratio (HR) of 0.26 (95% CI 0.08-0.9; P=.03). Conclusions. This is the first randomised controlled study assessing the effect of vitamin D and calcium supplementation on ischaemic stroke outcomes and points towards a potential benefit.

72;27590218;Edoxaban versus enoxaparin-warfarin in patients undergoing cardioversion of atrial fibrillation (ENSURE-AF): a randomised, open-label, phase 3b trial.;Background. Edoxaban, an oral factor Xa inhibitor, is non-inferior for prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with atrial fibrillation and is associated with less bleeding than well controlled warfarin therapy. Few safety data about edoxaban in patients undergoing electrical cardioversion are available. Methods. We did a multicentre, prospective, randomised, open-label, blinded-endpoint evaluation trial in 19 countries with 239 sites comparing edoxaban 60 mg per day with enoxaparin-warfarin in patients undergoing electrical cardioversion of non-valvular atrial fibrillation. The dose of edoxaban was reduced to 30 mg per day if one or more factors (creatinine clearance 15-50 mL/min, low bodyweight [≤60 kg], or concomitant use of P-glycoprotein inhibitors) were present. Block randomisation (block size four)-stratified by cardioversion approach (transoesophageal echocardiography [TEE] or not), anticoagulant experience, selected edoxaban dose, and region-was done through a voice-web system. The primary efficacy endpoint was a composite of stroke, systemic embolic event, myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular mortality, analysed by intention to treat. The primary safety endpoint was major and clinically relevant non-major (CRNM) bleeding in patients who received at least one dose of study drug. Follow-up was 28 days on study drug after cardioversion plus 30 days to assess safety. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02072434. Findings. Between March 25, 2014, and Oct 28, 2015, 2199 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive edoxaban (n=1095) or enoxaparin-warfarin (n=1104). The mean age was 64 years (SD 10·54) and mean CHA2DS2-VASc score was 2·6 (SD 1·4). Mean time in therapeutic range on warfarin was 70·8% (SD 27·4). The primary efficacy endpoint occurred in five (<1%) patients in the edoxaban group versus 11 (1%) in the enoxaparin-warfarin group (odds ratio [OR] 0·46, 95% CI 0·12-1·43). The primary safety endpoint occurred in 16 (1%) of 1067 patients given edoxaban versus 11 (1%) of 1082 patients given enoxaparin-warfarin (OR 1·48, 95% CI 0·64-3·55). The results were independent of the TEE-guided strategy and anticoagulation status. Interpretation. ENSURE-AF is the largest prospective randomised clinical trial of anticoagulation for cardioversion of patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Rates of major and CRNM bleeding and thromboembolism were low in the two treatment groups. Funding.

73;27639753;A phase III randomized trial evaluating alirocumab 300 mg every 4 weeks as monotherapy or add-on to statin: ODYSSEY CHOICE I.;"Background and aims. In previous phase III studies, the PCSK9 monoclonal antibody alirocumab was administered at doses of 75 or 150 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W). CHOICE I (NCT01926782) evaluated 300 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W) in patients on either maximally tolerated statin or no statin, both ± other lipid-lowering therapies. Methods. CHOICE I included patients with hypercholesterolemia at moderate-to-very-high cardiovascular risk. Patients were randomized to alirocumab 300 mg Q4W, 75 mg Q2W (calibrator arm), or placebo for 48 weeks, with dose adjustment for either alirocumab arm to 150 mg Q2W at Week (W) 12 if at W8 LDL-C levels were >70/100 mg/dL (1.8/2.6 mmol/L) depending on cardiovascular risk or LDL-C reduction was <30% from baseline. Co-primary endpoints were percent LDL-C change from baseline to W24, and to time-averaged LDL-C over W21-24. Results. Approximately two-thirds of randomized patients were receiving statins. At W12, 14.7% (no statin) and 19.3% (statin) of patients receiving alirocumab 300 mg Q4W required dose adjustment. At W24, significant LDL-C reductions from baseline were observed with alirocumab 300 mg Q4W: mean differences were -52.7% (no statin; placebo: -0.3%) and -58.8% (statin; placebo: -0.1%). Average LDL-C reductions from baseline to W21-24 were also significantly greater with alirocumab 300 mg Q4W vs. placebo in patients not receiving (-56.9% vs. -1.6%) and receiving statin (-65.8% vs. -0.8%). Treatment-emergent adverse event rates ranged from 61.1 to 75.0% (placebo) and 71.5 to 78.1% (alirocumab 300 mg Q4W). Conclusions.

74;27678439;Efficacy and safety of gemcabene as add-on to stable statin therapy in hypercholesterolemic patients.;Background. Ezetimibe added to statin therapy further reduces LDL-C and clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease compared to statin alone. However, the number of effective and safe oral agents for patients not at LDL-C goal is limited. In prior clinical trials, gemcabene reduced LDL-C and was generally well-tolerated in nearly 900 patients treated for up to 12 weeks. Objective. To evaluate the LDL-C lowering and safety of gemcabene as add-on to stable statin therapy in hypercholesterolemic patients. Methods. This was an 8-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, phase 2 study in men and postmenopausal women ≥18 and ≤65 years of age with LDL-C ≥130 mg/dL (3.4 mmol/L) while on low-intensity to high-intensity stable statin (the majority on moderate intensity) therapy. Sixty-six patients were randomized 1:1:1 to gemcabene 300 mg, 900 mg, or placebo QD. Results. Gemcabene 300 mg and 900 mg produced a mean percent change in LDL-C of -23.4 ± 4.7% (P = .005) and -27.7 ± 4.3% (P < .001), respectively, vs -6.2 ± 4.3% for placebo. The median percent change in CRP was -26.1% (P = .196) and -53.9% (P < .001) for gemcabene 300 mg and 900 mg, respectively, vs -11.1% for placebo. Gemcabene 300 mg and 900 mg were well-tolerated with no significant difference in AEs compared to placebo. Conclusions. Gemcabene as add-on to stable statin therapy demonstrated additional dose-dependent and statistically significant reductions in LDL-C of >20% and CRP >40% compared to placebo. The results support gemcabene-continued development for patients requiring LDL-C lowering beyond that provided by background statin therapy.;Circulatory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train
75;27756804;Endovascular therapy for acute ischaemic stroke: the Pragmatic Ischaemic Stroke Thrombectomy Evaluation (PISTE) randomised, controlled trial.;"Objective. The Pragmatic Ischaemic Thrombectomy Evaluation (PISTE) trial was a multicentre, randomised, controlled clinical trial comparing intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) alone with IVT and adjunctive intra-arterial mechanical thrombectomy (MT) in patients who had acute ischaemic stroke with large artery occlusive anterior circulation stroke confirmed on CT angiography (CTA). Design. Eligible patients had IVT started within 4.5 hours of stroke symptom onset. Those randomised to additional MT underwent thrombectomy using any Conformite Europeene (CE)-marked device, with target interval times for IVT start to arterial puncture of <90 min. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients achieving independence defined by a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0-2 at day 90. Results. Ten UK centres enrolled 65 patients between April 2013 and April 2015. Median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 16 (IQR 13-21). Median stroke onset to IVT start was 120 min. In the intention-to-treat analysis, there was no significant difference in disability-free survival at day 90 with MT (absolute difference 11%, adjusted OR 2.12, 95% CI 0.65 to 6.94, p=0.20). Secondary analyses showed significantly greater likelihood of full neurological recovery (mRS 0-1) at day 90 (OR 7.6, 95% CI 1.6 to 37.2, p=0.010). In the per-protocol population (n=58), the primary and most secondary clinical outcomes significantly favoured MT (absolute difference in mRS 0-2 of 22% and adjusted OR 4.9, 95% CI 1.2 to 19.7, p=0.021). Conclusions. The trial did not find a significant difference between treatment groups for the primary end point. However, the effect size was consistent with published data and across primary and secondary end points. Proceeding as fast as possible to MT after CTA confirmation of large artery occlusion on a background of intravenous alteplase is safe, improves excellent clinical outcomes and, in the per-protocol population, improves disability-free survival.

76;27846344;Effect of Evolocumab on Progression of Coronary Disease in Statin-Treated Patients: The GLAGOV Randomized Clinical Trial.;"Importance. Reducing levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) with intensive statin therapy reduces progression of coronary atherosclerosis in proportion to achieved LDL-C levels. Proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors produce incremental LDL-C lowering in statin-treated patients; however, the effects of these drugs on coronary atherosclerosis have not been evaluated. Objective. To determine the effects of PCSK9 inhibition with evolocumab on progression of coronary atherosclerosis in statin-treated patients. Design, setting, and participants. The GLAGOV multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial (enrollment May 3, 2013, to January 12, 2015) conducted at 197 academic and community hospitals in North America, Europe, South America, Asia, Australia, and South Africa and enrolling 968 patients presenting for coronary angiography. Interventions. Participants with angiographic coronary disease were randomized to receive monthly evolocumab (420 mg) (n = 484) or placebo (n = 484) via subcutaneous injection for 76 weeks, in addition to statins. Main outcomes and measures. The primary efficacy measure was the nominal change in percent atheroma volume (PAV) from baseline to week 78, measured by serial intravascular ultrasonography (IVUS) imaging. Secondary efficacy measures were nominal change in normalized total atheroma volume (TAV) and percentage of patients demonstrating plaque regression. Safety and tolerability were also evaluated. Results. Among the 968 treated patients (mean age, 59.8 years [SD, 9.2]; 269 [27.8%] women; mean LDL-C level, 92.5 mg/dL [SD, 27.2]), 846 had evaluable imaging at follow-up. Compared with placebo, the evolocumab group achieved lower mean, time-weighted LDL-C levels (93.0 vs 36.6 mg/dL; difference, -56.5 mg/dL [95% CI, -59.7 to -53.4]; P < .001). The primary efficacy parameter, PAV, increased 0.05% with placebo and decreased 0.95% with evolocumab (difference, -1.0% [95% CI, -1.8% to -0.64%]; P < .001). The secondary efficacy parameter, normalized TAV, decreased 0.9 mm3 with placebo and 5.8 mm3 with evolocumab (difference, -4.9 mm3 [95% CI, -7.3 to -2.5]; P < .001). Evolocumab induced plaque regression in a greater percentage of patients than placebo (64.3% vs 47.3%; difference, 17.0% [95% CI, 10.4% to 23.6%]; P < .001 for PAV and 61.5% vs 48.9%; difference, 12.5% [95% CI, 5.9% to 19.2%]; P < .001 for TAV). Conclusions and relevance. Among patients with angiographic coronary disease treated with statins, addition of evolocumab, compared with placebo, resulted in a greater decrease in PAV after 76 weeks of treatment. Further studies are needed to assess the effects of PCSK9 inhibition on clinical outcomes.

77;27849566;Effects of Sacubitril/Valsartan (LCZ696) on Natriuresis, Diuresis, Blood Pressures, and NT-proBNP in Salt-Sensitive Hypertension.;"Salt-sensitive hypertension (SSH) is characterized by impaired sodium excretion and subnormal vasodilatory response to salt loading. Sacubitril/valsartan (LCZ696) was hypothesized to increase natriuresis and diuresis and result in superior blood pressure control compared with valsartan in Asian patients with SSH. In this randomized, double-blind, crossover study, 72 patients with SSH received sacubitril/valsartan 400 mg and valsartan 320 mg once daily for 4 weeks each. SSH was diagnosed if the mean arterial pressure increased by ≥10% when patients switched from low (50 mmol/d) to high (320 mmol/d) sodium diet. The primary outcome was cumulative 6- and 24-hour sodium excretion after first dose administration. Compared with valsartan, sacubitril/valsartan was associated with a significant increase in natriuresis (adjusted treatment difference: 24.5 mmol/6 hours, 50.3 mmol/24 hours, both P<0.001) and diuresis (adjusted treatment difference: 291.2 mL/6 hours, P<0.001; 356.4 mL/24 hours, P=0.002) on day 1, but not on day 28, and greater reductions in office and ambulatory blood pressure on day 28. Despite morning dosing of both drugs, ambulatory blood pressure reductions were more pronounced at nighttime than at daytime or the 24-hour average. Compared with valsartan, sacubitril/valsartan significantly reduced N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide levels on day 28 (adjusted treatment difference: -20%; P=0.001). Sacubitril/valsartan and valsartan were safe and well tolerated with no significant changes in body weight or serum sodium and potassium levels with either treatments. In conclusion, sacubitril/valsartan compared with valsartan was associated with short-term increases in natriuresis and diuresis, superior office and ambulatory blood pressure control, and significantly reduced N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide levels in Asian patients with SSH.

Peripheral artery disease is considered to be a manifestation of systemic atherosclerosis with associated adverse cardiovascular and limb events. Data from previous trials have suggested that patients receiving clopidogrel monotherapy had a lower risk of cardiovascular events than those receiving aspirin. We wanted to compare clopidogrel with ticagrelor, a potent antiplatelet agent, in patients with peripheral artery disease. Methods. In this double-blind, event-driven trial, we randomly assigned 13,885 patients with symptomatic peripheral artery disease to receive monotherapy with ticagrelor (90 mg twice daily) or clopidogrel (75 mg once daily). Patients were eligible if they had an ankle-brachial index (ABI) of 0.80 or less or had undergone previous revascularization of the lower limbs. The primary efficacy end point was a composite of adjudicated cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or ischemic stroke. The primary safety end point was major bleeding. The median follow-up was 30 months. Results. The median age of the patients was 66 years, and 72% were men; 43% were enrolled on the basis of the ABI and 57% on the basis of previous revascularization. The mean baseline ABI in all patients was 0.71, 76.6% of the patients had claudication, and 4.6% had critical limb ischemia. The primary efficacy end point occurred in 751 of 6930 patients (10.8%) receiving ticagrelor and in 740 of 6955 (10.6%) receiving clopidogrel (hazard ratio, 1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.92 to 1.13; P=0.65). In each group, acute limb ischemia occurred in 1.7% of the patients (hazard ratio, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.79 to 1.33; P=0.85) and major bleeding in 1.6% (hazard ratio, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.84 to 1.43; P=0.49). Conclusions. In patients with symptomatic peripheral artery disease, ticagrelor was not shown to be superior to clopidogrel for the reduction of cardiovascular events. Major bleeding occurred at similar rates among the patients in the two trial groups.

79;27984005;Treatment-Resistant Hypertension and Outcomes Based on Randomized Treatment Group in ALLHAT.;"Background. Although hypertension guidelines define treatment-resistant hypertension as blood pressure uncontrolled by ≥3 antihypertensive medications, including a diuretic, it is unknown whether patient prognosis differs when a diuretic is included. Methods. Participants in the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) were randomly assigned to first-step therapy with chlorthalidone, amlodipine, or lisinopril. At a Year 2 follow-up visit, those with average blood pressure ≥140 mm Hg systolic or ≥90 mm Hg diastolic on ≥3 antihypertensive medications, or blood pressure <140/90 mm Hg on ≥4 antihypertensive medications were identified as having apparent treatment-resistant hypertension. The prevalence of treatment-resistant hypertension and its association with ALLHAT primary (combined fatal coronary heart disease or nonfatal myocardial infarction) and secondary (all-cause mortality, stroke, heart failure, combined coronary heart disease, and combined cardiovascular disease) outcomes were identified for each treatment group. Results. Of participants assigned to chlorthalidone, amlodipine, or lisinopril, 9.6%, 11.4%, and 19.7%, respectively, had treatment-resistant hypertension. During mean follow-up of 2.9 years, primary outcome incidence was similar for those assigned to chlorthalidone compared with amlodipine or lisinopril (amlodipine- vs chlorthalidone-adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.53-1.39; P = .53; lisinopril- vs chlorthalidone-adjusted HR = 1.06; 95% CI, 0.70-1.60; P = .78). Secondary outcome risks were similar for most comparisons except coronary revascularization, which was higher with amlodipine than with chlorthalidone (HR 1.86; 95% CI, 1.11-3.11; P = .02). An as-treated analysis based on diuretic use produced similar results. Conclusions. In this study, which titrated medications to a goal, participants assigned to chlorthalidone were less likely to develop treatment-resistant hypertension.

80;27993387;Low vitamin D does not predict statin associated muscle symptoms but is associated with transient increases in muscle damage and pain.;"Background and aims. Low vitamin D (VITD) may contribute to statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS). We examined the influence of baseline and change in VITD in patients with verified SAMS. Methods. SAMS was verified in 120 patients with prior statin muscle complaints using 8-week randomized, double-blind crossover trials of simvastatin (SIMVA) 20 mg/d and placebo. 25 (OH)vitamin D was measured at each phase of the trial. Results. Forty-three patients (35.8%) experienced muscle pain on SIMVA but not placebo, exhibiting confirmed SAMS. VITD (mean ± standard deviation) prior to SIMVA treatment was not different between patients who did (31.7 ± 12.1 ng/mL, n = 43) or did not (31.6 ± 10.3 ng/mL, n = 77) develop SAMS and did not predict SAMS (p = 0.96). The change in VITD with SIMVA treatment was not different between patients with and without SAMS (0.3 ± 5.9 vs. 0.2 ± 8.3 ng/mL, respectively) and did not predict SAMS (p = 0.96). The proportion of patients classified as VITD deficient (<20 ng/mL) did not differ between patients with (n = 16) and without (n = 10) SAMS (χ2 = 1.45; p = 0.23), nor did the proportion of patients classified as VITD insufficient (<30 ng/mL) (n = 42 vs. 48; χ2 < 0.01 and p = 0.94). Both baseline and on-statin VITD were inversely related to the change in creatine kinase (CK) with statin therapy (p = 0.01 and 0.02, respectively), independent of SAMS (p = 0.36 and 0.35). Conclusions. Baseline VITD, VITD deficiency/insufficiency and changes in VITD with statin therapy do not predict SAMS in patients with rigorously verified SAMS. However, low VITD may exacerbate statin-induced muscle injury and could contribute to SAMS development with a longer duration of statin treatment.";Circulatory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train
81;28007331;Combination Therapy of Rosuvastatin and Ezetimibe in Patients with High Cardiovascular Risk.;"Purpose. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of rosuvastatin/ezetimibe combination therapy in Korean patients with high cardiovascular risk. Methods. This was a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. A total of 337 patients were screened. After a 4-week run-in period, 245 of these patients with high or moderately high risk as defined by the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines were randomly assigned. Patients received 1 of 6 regimens for 8 weeks as follows: (1) rosuvastatin 5 mg, (2) rosuvastatin 5 mg/ezetimibe 10 mg, (3) rosuvastatin 10 mg, (4) rosuvastatin 10 mg/ezetimibe 10 mg, (5) rosuvastatin 20 mg, or (6) rosuvastatin 20 mg/ezetimibe 10 mg. The primary outcome variable was percentage change in the level of LDL-C at week 8 of drug treatment. Secondary outcome variables included percentage changes of other lipid variables and achievement rates of LDL-C targets. Tolerability analyses were also performed. Findings. The percentage change of LDL-C ranged from -45% to -56% (mean, -51%) in the monotherapy groups and from -58% to -63% (mean, -60%) in the combination therapy groups. The percentage change was greater in the pooled combination therapy group than in the counterpart (P < 0.001 for the pooled groups); this difference was more obvious for regimens with a lower statin dose. The percentage reductions of total cholesterol and triglycerides were greater in the combination groups than in the monotherapy groups. The LDL-C target achievement rates were 64% to 87% (mean, 73%) in the monotherapy groups and 87% to 95% (mean, 91%) in the combination groups (P = 0.01 for the pooled groups). The rates were significantly greater in patients receiving the combination therapy than in the monotherapy at lower doses of rosuvastatin. The proportions of patients with various adverse events were not significantly different between the groups. Implications. Rosuvastatin/ezetimibe combination therapy has better efficacy and target achievement rates than rosuvastatin monotherapy in patients with high cardiovascular risk.";Circulatory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Test
82;28062625;High-Sensitivity Troponin I in Stable Patients with Atherosclerotic Disease in the TRA 2°P - TIMI 50 Trial.;"Background. Cardiac troponin I, measured with a high-sensitivity assay (hs-TnI), is well-established for risk prediction in acute coronary syndromes. However, its prognostic role in stable atherosclerotic disease, particularly for future myocardial infarction (MI), is less well defined. Methods. We measured hs-TnI (Abbott ARCHITECT) in 15833 patients with prior MI, ischemic stroke, or peripheral arterial disease from the placebo-controlled Thrombin Receptor Antagonist in Secondary Prevention of Atherothrombotic Ischemic Events (TRA 2°P)-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) 50 trial of the platelet inhibitor vorapaxar, excluding patients with recent MI (<30 days). hs-TnI was categorized into 5 groups based on the detection limit (1.9 ng/L), 99th percentile reference limit (26 ng/L), and tertiles in between (1.9-26 ng/L), as well as sex-specific reference limits. Results. Higher hs-TnI concentration was associated with older age, male sex, and increased atherosclerosis burden. hs-TnI identified a graded 3-year risk of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke from 5.0% to 18.6% (P < 0.001), driven by cardiovascular death and MI (P < 0.001). This risk was independent of established clinical risk indicators, B-type natriuretic peptide and C-reactive protein [adjusted hazard ratio 2.70 (95% CI, 1.96-3.71), P < 0.001 for hs-TnI >26 ng/L vs <1.9 ng/L]. In patients with prior MI, there was a pattern of greater absolute benefit with vorapaxar in patients with an increased hs-TnI (absolute risk difference 1.9% with hs-TnI >26 ng/L vs 0.3% with hs-TnI <1.9 ng/L; P interaction = 0.82). Conclusions. In stable patients with established atherosclerosis, hs-TnI concentrations effectively stratified the risk of new or recurrent cardiovascular (CV) events, in particular CV death and MI. High-risk patients with prior MI identified by increased hs-TnI had a substantial absolute improvement in net clinical outcome with vorapaxar.";Circulatory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train
83;28190578;Quarter-dose quadruple combination therapy for initial treatment of hypertension: placebo-controlled, crossover, randomised trial and systematic review.;"Background. Globally, most patients with hypertension are treated with monotherapy, and control rates are poor because monotherapy only reduces blood pressure by around 9/5 mm Hg on average. There is a pressing need for blood pressure-control strategies with improved efficacy and tolerability. We aimed to assess whether ultra-low-dose combination therapy could meet these needs. Methods. We did a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover trial of a quadpill-a single capsule containing four blood pressure-lowering drugs each at quarter-dose (irbesartan 37·5 mg, amlodipine 1·25 mg, hydrochlorothiazide 6·25 mg, and atenolol 12·5 mg). Participants with untreated hypertension were enrolled from four centres in the community of western Sydney, NSW, Australia, mainly by general practitioners. Participants were randomly allocated by computer to either the quadpill or matching placebo for 4 weeks; this treatment was followed by a 2-week washout, then the other study treatment was administered for 4 weeks. Study staff and participants were unaware of treatment allocations, and masking was achieved by use of identical opaque capsules. The primary outcome was placebo-corrected 24-h systolic ambulatory blood pressure reduction after 4 weeks and analysis was by intention to treat. We also did a systematic review of trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of quarter-standard-dose blood pressure-lowering therapy against placebo. This trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, number ACTRN12614001057673. The trial ended after 1 year and this report presents the final analysis. Findings. Between November, 2014, and December, 2015, 55 patients were screened for our randomised trial, of whom 21 underwent randomisation. Mean age of participants was 58 years (SD 11) and mean baseline office and 24-h systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels were 154 (14)/90 (11) mm Hg and 140 (9)/87 (8) mm Hg, respectively. One individual declined participation after randomisation and two patients dropped out for administrative reasons. The placebo-corrected reduction in systolic 24-h blood pressure with the quadpill was 19 mm Hg (95% CI 14-23), and office blood pressure was reduced by 22/13 mm Hg (p<0·0001). During quadpill treatment, 18 (100%) of 18 participants achieved office blood pressure less than 140/90 mm Hg, compared with six (33%) of 18 during placebo treatment (p=0·0013). There were no serious adverse events and all patients reported that the quadpill was easy to swallow. Our systematic review identified 36 trials (n=4721 participants) of one drug at quarter-dose and six trials (n=312) of two drugs at quarter-dose, against placebo. The pooled placebo-corrected blood pressure-lowering effects were 5/2 mm Hg and 7/5 mm Hg, respectively (both p<0·0001), and there were no side-effects from either regimen. Interpretation. The findings of our small trial in the context of previous randomised evidence suggest that the benefits of quarter-dose therapy could be additive across classes and might confer a clinically important reduction in blood pressure. Further examination of the quadpill concept is needed to investigate effectiveness against usual treatment options and longer term tolerability. Funding.

84;28279428;Nadroparin or fondaparinux versus no thromboprophylaxis in patients immobilised in a below-knee plaster cast (PROTECT): A randomised controlled trial.;"Background. The immobilisation of the lower leg is associated with deep vein thrombosis (DVT). However, thromboprophylaxis in patients with a below-knee plaster cast remains controversial. We examined the efficacy and safety of nadroparin and fondaparinux to ascertain the need for thromboprophylaxis in these patients. Methods. PROTECT was a randomised, controlled, single-blind, multicentre study that enrolled adults with an ankle or foot fracture who required immobilisation for a minimum of four weeks. The patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to a control group (no thromboprophylaxis) or to one of the intervention groups: daily subcutaneous self-injection of either nadroparin (2850 IE anti-Xa=0.3ml) or fondaparinux (2.5mg=0.5ml). A venous duplex sonography was performed after the removal of the cast or earlier if thrombosis was suspected. The primary outcome was the relative risk of developing DVT in the control group compared with that in both intervention groups. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00881088. Results. Between April 2009 and December 2015, 467 patients were enrolled and assigned to either the nadroparin group (n=154), the fondaparinux group (n=157), or the control group (n=156). A total of 273 patients (92, 92, and 94 patients, respectively) were analysed. The incidence of DVT in the nadroparin group was 2/92 (2.2%) compared with 11/94 (11.7%) in the control group, with a relative risk of 5.4 (95% CI 1.2-23.6; p=0.011). The incidence of DVT in the fondaparinux group was 1/92 (1.1%), yielding a relative risk of 10.8 (95% CI 1.4-80.7; p=0.003) compared with that in the control group. No major complications occurred in any group. Conclusion. Thromboprophylaxis with nadroparin or fondaparinux significantly reduces the risk of DVT in patients with an ankle or foot fracture who were treated in a below-knee cast without any major adverse events.";Circulatory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train

In this study, we evaluated the effect of mipomersen in patients with severe LDL-hypercholesterolaemia and atherosclerosis, treated by lipid lowering drugs and regular lipoprotein apheresis. Methods. This prospective, randomized, controlled phase II single center trial enrolled 15 patients (9 males, 6 females; 59 ± 9 y, BMI 27 ± 4 kg/m2) with established atherosclerosis, LDL-cholesterol ≥130 mg/dL (3.4 mmol/L) despite maximal possible drug therapy, and fulfilling German criteria for regular lipoprotein apheresis. All patients were on stable lipid lowering drug therapy and regular apheresis for >3 months. Patients randomized to treatment (n = 11) self-injected mipomersen 200 mg sc weekly, at day 4 after apheresis, for 26 weeks. Patients randomized to control (n = 4) continued apheresis without injection. The primary endpoint was the change in pre-apheresis LDL-cholesterol. Results. Of the patients randomized to mipomersen, 3 discontinued the drug early (<12 weeks therapy) for side effects. For these, another 3 were recruited and randomized. Further, 4 patients discontinued mipomersen between 12 and 26 weeks for side effects (moderate to severe injection site reactions n = 3 and elevated liver enzymes n = 1). In those treated for >12 weeks, mipomersen reduced pre-apheresis LDL-cholesterol significantly by 22.6 ± 17.0%, from a baseline of 4.8 ± 1.2 mmol/L to 3.7 ± 0.9 mmol/L, while there was no significant change in the control group (+1.6 ± 9.3%), with the difference between the groups being significant (p=0.006). Mipomersen also decreased pre-apheresis lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) concentration from a median baseline of 40.2mg/dL (32.5,71) by 15% (-19.4,3.6) though without significance (p=0.3). Conclusions. Mipomersen reduces LDL-cholesterol (significantly) and Lp(a) (non-significantly) in patients on maximal lipid-lowering drug therapy and regular apheresis, but is often associated with side effects.";Circulatory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train
86;28316279;Rivaroxaban or Aspirin for Extended Treatment of Venous Thromboembolism.;"Background. Although many patients with venous thromboembolism require extended treatment, it is uncertain whether it is better to use full- or lower-intensity anticoagulation therapy or aspirin. Methods. In this randomized, double-blind, phase 3 study, we assigned 3396 patients with venous thromboembolism to receive either once-daily rivaroxaban (at doses of 20 mg or 10 mg) or 100 mg of aspirin. All the study patients had completed 6 to 12 months of anticoagulation therapy and were in equipoise regarding the need for continued anticoagulation. Study drugs were administered for up to 12 months. The primary efficacy outcome was symptomatic recurrent fatal or nonfatal venous thromboembolism, and the principal safety outcome was major bleeding. Results. A total of 3365 patients were included in the intention-to-treat analyses (median treatment duration, 351 days). The primary efficacy outcome occurred in 17 of 1107 patients (1.5%) receiving 20 mg of rivaroxaban and in 13 of 1127 patients (1.2%) receiving 10 mg of rivaroxaban, as compared with 50 of 1131 patients (4.4%) receiving aspirin (hazard ratio for 20 mg of rivaroxaban vs. aspirin, 0.34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.20 to 0.59; hazard ratio for 10 mg of rivaroxaban vs. aspirin, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.14 to 0.47; P<0.001 for both comparisons). Rates of major bleeding were 0.5% in the group receiving 20 mg of rivaroxaban, 0.4% in the group receiving 10 mg of rivaroxaban, and 0.3% in the aspirin group; the rates of clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding were 2.7%, 2.0%, and 1.8%, respectively. The incidence of adverse events was similar in all three groups. Conclusions. Among patients with venous thromboembolism in equipoise for continued anticoagulation, the risk of a recurrent event was significantly lower with rivaroxaban at either a treatment dose (20 mg) or a prophylactic dose (10 mg) than with aspirin, without a significant increase in bleeding rates.

87;28454498;Efficacy of Citalopram on Acute Ischemic Stroke Outcome: A Randomized Clinical Trial.;"Background and purpose. Ischemic stroke (IS) is one of the main causes of death and disability in the adult population, and recovery from it is a major health concern worldwide. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of citalopram on 3-mounth outcome of nondepressed acute IS patients. Methods. In a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, 144 patients with acute IS were studied for 3 months. In one group, the patients received oral citalopram 20 mg (once daily), and in the other group, they received placebo. All patients received standard care, including physiotherapy. Patients with depression were excluded throughout the study. The primary outcome of the study was set to a 50% reduction in the 3-month National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale compared with the baseline scores (Clinical Trial Registration URL: http://www.irct.ir ; Unique identifier: IRCT201203192150N2). Results. The mean age of patients was 66.4 years. Of 144 eligible patients, 15 patients died (4 in the citalopram and 11 in the placebo group), and 21 patients did not complete the study follow-up period (10 in the citalopram and 11 in the placebo group). The primary outcome of the study was achieved in 57 patients (79%) in the citalopram and 39 patients (54%) in the placebo group ( P < .001), with risk ratio and number needed to treat of 2 (CI = 1.2-3) and 4 (CI = 2.5-8.6), respectively. No major adverse events were found in either group. Conclusions.

88;28645473;Efficacy and Safety of Rivaroxaban Versus Warfarin in Patients Taking Nondihydropyridine Calcium Channel Blockers for Atrial Fibrillation (from the ROCKET AF Trial).;"Non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (non-DHP CCBs) possess combined P-glycoprotein and moderate CYP3A4 inhibition, which may lead to increased exposure of medications that are substrates for these metabolic pathways, such as rivaroxaban. We evaluated the use and outcomes of non-DHP CCBs in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) in Rivaroxaban Once Daily Oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibition Compared with Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation (ROCKET AF). We assessed clinical outcomes in patients who received non-DHP CCBs and the impact on the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban compared with warfarin. Stroke or noncentral nervous system (CNS) systemic embolism (SE), major or nonmajor clinically relevant (NMCR) bleeding, all-cause death, and major bleeding were compared according to non-DHP CCB use. At randomization, 1,308 patients (9.2%) were taking a non-DHP CCB. They were more likely to be women, have diabetes and COPD, and less likely to have heart failure and had a lower mean CHADS score (3.3 vs 3.5). Non-DHP CCB use was not associated with an increased risk of stroke/non-CNS SE (p = 0.11) or the composite outcome of NMCR or major bleeding (p = 0.087). Non-DHP CCB use was associated with an increased risk of major bleeding (adjusted hazard ratio 1.50, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.04) and intracranial hemorrhage (adjusted hazard ratio 2.84, 95% CI 1.53 to 5.29). No significant difference was observed in the primary efficacy (stroke or non-CNS SE; adjusted interaction p value = 0.38) or safety outcome (NMCR or major bleeding; adjusted interaction p value = 0.14) between rivaroxaban and warfarin with non-DHP CCB use. In conclusion, although the overall use of non-DHP CCBs was associated with an increased risk of major bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage, the use was not associated with a significant change in the safety or efficacy of rivaroxaban compared with warfarin observed in ROCKET AF.";Circulatory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train
89;28700781;Efficacy and Safety of Spironolactone in Acute Heart Failure: The ATHENA-HF Randomized Clinical Trial.;Importance. Persistent congestion is associated with worse outcomes in acute heart failure (AHF). Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists administered at high doses may relieve congestion, overcome diuretic resistance, and mitigate the effects of adverse neurohormonal activation in AHF. Objective. To assess the effect of high-dose spironolactone and usual care on N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels compared with usual care alone. Design, setting, and participants. This double-blind and placebo (or low-dose)-controlled randomized clinical trial was conducted in 22 US acute care hospitals among patients with AHF who were previously receiving no or low-dose (12.5 mg or 25 mg daily) spironolactone and had NT-proBNP levels of 1000 pg/mL or more or B-type natriuretic peptide levels of 250 pg/mL or more, regardless of ejection fraction. Interventions. High-dose spironolactone (100 mg) vs placebo or 25 mg spironolactone (usual care) daily for 96 hours. Main outcomes and measures. The primary end point was the change in NT-proBNP levels from baseline to 96 hours. Secondary end points included the clinical congestion score, dyspnea assessment, net urine output, and net weight change. Safety end points included hyperkalemia and changes in renal function. Results. A total of 360 patients were randomized, of whom the median age was 65 years, 129 (36%) were women, 200 (55.5%) were white, 151 (42%) were black, 8 (2%) were Hispanic or Latino, 9 (2.5%) were of other race/ethnicity, and the median left ventricular ejection fraction was 34%. Baseline median (interquartile range) NT-proBNP levels were 4601 (2697-9596) pg/mL among the group treated with high-dose spironolactone and 3753 (1968-7633) pg/mL among the group who received usual care. There was no significant difference in the log NT-proBNP reduction between the 2 groups (-0.55 [95% CI, -0.92 to -0.18] with high-dose spironolactone and -0.49 [95% CI, -0.98 to -0.14] with usual care, P = .57).

90;28776894;PERSEPT 1: a phase 3 trial of activated eptacog beta for on-demand treatment of haemophilia inhibitor-related bleeding.;"Introduction. Haemophilia A or B patients with inhibitors have been treated with FVIIa-containing bypassing agents for over 20 years. However, due to uncertainty regarding dose response and thrombotic risk, the use of a gradual, titrated, minimal dosing strategy remains prevalent, potentially hampering early haemostasis. Aim. Evaluate the dose-dependent efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of activated eptacog beta (rhFVIIa), a new recombinant inhibitor bypassing agent for the treatment of bleeding episodes (BEs). Methods. A Phase 3, randomized, cross-over study of initial dose regimens (IDRs) in 27 bleeding congenital haemophilia A or B subjects with inhibitors was conducted to evaluate on-demand treatment of mild/moderate BEs. Intravenous 75 μg/kg or 225 μg/kg initial doses with 75 μg/kg subsequent doses by schedule were administered until clinical response. Results. The primary endpoint was sustained clinical response within 12 hours, determined by a composite of objective and pain measures. In the 75 μg/kg IDR, 84.9% (95% CI; 74.0%, 95.7%) of mild/moderate BEs at 12 hours were successfully treated compared to 93.2% (95% CI; 88.1%, 98.3%) treated in the 225 μg/kg IDR. Efficacy between the IDRs was statistically different (P<.020) in mild/moderate bleeding episodes. Both IDRs were well tolerated with no detectable immunogenic or thrombotic responses to rhFVIIa or host cell proteins. Conclusion. The dose-dependent efficacy seen in this study supports individualizing the initial dose of eptacog beta to optimize clinical response. By reducing uncertainty, the PERSEPT 1 results should increase the adoption of early haemostasis as a treatment goal for clinicians who treat haemorrhage in the inhibitor population.";Circulatory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train
91;28837213;Antithrombotic potency of ticagrelor versus clopidogrel in type-2 diabetic patients with cardiovascular disease.;Type-2 Diabetes Mellitus [T2DM] is associated with increased platelet reactivity and hypo-response to antiplatelet drugs. Ticagrelor, with its faster and more potent antiplatelet effects, was shown to reduce adverse events more than clopidogrel in the overall CAD patient population of PLATO trial, but the benefits did not reach statistical significance in the T2DM subgroup. To better understand these findings, we compared the antithrombotic effects of ticagrelor versus with clopidogrel in T2DM patients with cardiovascular disease. In a randomized, 2 treatment-sequence, crossover-design, T2DM patients (n=20, 57±8 years, 60 % male) received a loading-dose [LD] plus one week of daily-therapy [DT] of clopidogrel or ticagrelor. Treatment effects were assessed by measuring thrombus formation (Badimon Chamber) and platelet aggregation (Multiple Electrode Aggregometry (MEA) Analyzer and VerifyNow®) at 2- and 6-hour post-LD and on Day-7 of DT, in comparison with pre-treatment baseline. After 2 weeks of washout, patients switched to the second treatment under identical testing conditions. Ticagrelor significantly reduced thrombus formation versus baseline at 2- and 6-hour post-LD and Day-7 of DT (33 %, 40 % and 31 %, respectively, p<0.01 for all) whereas thrombus reductions with clopidogrel were much lower and significant only at 6-hour post-LD (16 %, 20 % and 17 %, respectively). Antithrombotic effect of ticagrelor at 6-hour was significantly stronger than clopidogrel (p<0.05). Platelet aggregation (MEA and VerifyNow®) was inhibited by both treatments but effects of ticagrelor were significantly stronger at each time-point. Ticagrelor exhibits a faster and more potent antithrombotic effect than clopidogrel in T2DM patients with cardiovascular disease, supporting its use in this population.;Circulatory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train

We evaluated whether rivaroxaban alone or in combination with aspirin would be more effective than aspirin alone for secondary cardiovascular prevention. Methods. In this double-blind trial, we randomly assigned 27,395 participants with stable atherosclerotic vascular disease to receive rivaroxaban (2.5 mg twice daily) plus aspirin (100 mg once daily), rivaroxaban (5 mg twice daily), or aspirin (100 mg once daily). The primary outcome was a composite of cardiovascular death, stroke, or myocardial infarction. The study was stopped for superiority of the rivaroxaban-plus-aspirin group after a mean follow-up of 23 months. Results. The primary outcome occurred in fewer patients in the rivaroxaban-plus-aspirin group than in the aspirin-alone group (379 patients [4.1%] vs. 496 patients [5.4%]; hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.66 to 0.86; P<0.001; z=-4.126), but major bleeding events occurred in more patients in the rivaroxaban-plus-aspirin group (288 patients [3.1%] vs. 170 patients [1.9%]; hazard ratio, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.40 to 2.05; P<0.001). There was no significant difference in intracranial or fatal bleeding between these two groups. There were 313 deaths (3.4%) in the rivaroxaban-plus-aspirin group as compared with 378 (4.1%) in the aspirin-alone group (hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.71 to 0.96; P=0.01; threshold P value for significance, 0.0025). The primary outcome did not occur in significantly fewer patients in the rivaroxaban-alone group than in the aspirin-alone group, but major bleeding events occurred in more patients in the rivaroxaban-alone group. Conclusions. Among patients with stable atherosclerotic vascular disease, those assigned to rivaroxaban (2.5 mg twice daily) plus aspirin had better cardiovascular outcomes and more major bleeding events than those assigned to aspirin alone. Rivaroxaban (5 mg twice daily) alone did not result in better cardiovascular outcomes than aspirin alone and resulted in more major bleeding events.

93;28847206;Effects of Anacetrapib in Patients with Atherosclerotic Vascular Disease.;"Background. Patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease remain at high risk for cardiovascular events despite effective statin-based treatment of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. The inhibition of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) by anacetrapib reduces LDL cholesterol levels and increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. However, trials of other CETP inhibitors have shown neutral or adverse effects on cardiovascular outcomes. Methods. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving 30,449 adults with atherosclerotic vascular disease who were receiving intensive atorvastatin therapy and who had a mean LDL cholesterol level of 61 mg per deciliter (1.58 mmol per liter), a mean non-HDL cholesterol level of 92 mg per deciliter (2.38 mmol per liter), and a mean HDL cholesterol level of 40 mg per deciliter (1.03 mmol per liter). The patients were assigned to receive either 100 mg of anacetrapib once daily (15,225 patients) or matching placebo (15,224 patients). The primary outcome was the first major coronary event, a composite of coronary death, myocardial infarction, or coronary revascularization. Results. During the median follow-up period of 4.1 years, the primary outcome occurred in significantly fewer patients in the anacetrapib group than in the placebo group (1640 of 15,225 patients [10.8%] vs. 1803 of 15,224 patients [11.8%]; rate ratio, 0.91; 95% confidence interval, 0.85 to 0.97; P=0.004).

At the trial midpoint, the mean level of HDL cholesterol was higher by 43 mg per deciliter (1.12 mmol per liter) in the anacetrapib group than in the placebo group (a relative difference of 104%), and the mean level of non-HDL cholesterol was lower by 17 mg per deciliter (0.44 mmol per liter), a relative difference of -18%. There were no significant between-group differences in the risk of death, cancer, or other serious adverse events. Conclusions. Among patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease who were receiving intensive statin therapy, the use of anacetrapib resulted in a lower incidence of major coronary events than the use of placebo.

94;28902590;Long-Term Outcomes of Patent Foramen Ovale Closure or Medical Therapy after Stroke.;"Background. Whether closure of a patent foramen ovale reduces the risk of recurrence of ischemic stroke in patients who have had a cryptogenic ischemic stroke is unknown. Methods. In a multicenter, randomized, open-label trial, with blinded adjudication of end-point events, we randomly assigned patients 18 to 60 years of age who had a patent foramen ovale (PFO) and had had a cryptogenic ischemic stroke to undergo closure of the PFO (PFO closure group) or to receive medical therapy alone (aspirin, warfarin, clopidogrel, or aspirin combined with extended-release dipyridamole; medical-therapy group). The primary efficacy end point was a composite of recurrent nonfatal ischemic stroke, fatal ischemic stroke, or early death after randomization. The results of the analysis of the primary outcome from the original trial period have been reported previously; the current analysis of data from the extended follow-up period was considered to be exploratory. Results. We enrolled 980 patients (mean age, 45.9 years) at 69 sites. Patients were followed for a median of 5.9 years. Treatment exposure in the two groups was unequal (3141 patient-years in the PFO closure group vs. 2669 patient-years in the medical-therapy group), owing to a higher dropout rate in the medical-therapy group. In the intention-to-treat population, recurrent ischemic stroke occurred in 18 patients in the PFO closure group and in 28 patients in the medical-therapy group, resulting in rates of 0.58 events per 100 patient-years and 1.07 events per 100 patient-years, respectively (hazard ratio with PFO closure vs. medical therapy, 0.55; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.31 to 0.999; P=0.046 by the log-rank test). Recurrent ischemic stroke of undetermined cause occurred in 10 patients in the PFO closure group and in 23 patients in the medical-therapy group (hazard ratio, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.18 to 0.79; P=0.007). Venous thromboembolism (which comprised events of pulmonary embolism and deep-vein thrombosis) was more common in the PFO closure group than in the medical-therapy group. Conclusions. Among adults who had had a cryptogenic ischemic stroke, closure of a PFO was associated with a lower rate of recurrent ischemic strokes than medical therapy alone during extended follow-up.

95;28939406;Comparison of Fixed-dose Combinations of Amlodipine/Losartan Potassium/Chlorthalidone and Amlodipine/Losartan Potassium in Patients With Stage 2 Hypertension Inadequately Controlled With Amlodipine/Losartan Potassium: A Randomized, Double-blind, Multicenter, Phase III Study.;"Purpose. The goal of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of fixed-dose combinations of amlodipine/losartan potassium/chlorthalidone (A/L/C) and A/L in Korean patients with stage 2 hypertension inadequately controlled by A/L. Methods. This study was an 8-week, randomized double-blind, multicenter, phase III clinical trial. Three hundred forty volunteer patients with stage 2 hypertension were randomized to receive A/L/C or A/L. The primary end point was a change in sitting systolic blood pressure (SitSBP) after 8 weeks of treatment. As secondary end points, the change in SitSBP after 2 weeks of treatment and the change in sitting diastolic blood pressure (SitDBP) were compared between treatment groups. All patients were assessed for adverse events, clinical laboratory data, and vital signs. Findings. Of 330 patients from 33 medical centers, 328 patients who had available efficacy data were analyzed. After 8 weeks of double-blind treatment, the mean (SD) changes in SitSBP at 8 weeks were -16.4 (0.9) mm Hg and -6.9 (1.0) mm Hg in the A/L/C and A/L groups, respectively. A/L/C had a statistically superior blood pressure-lowering effect compared with that of A/L (mean [SD] difference, 9.5 [1.3] mm Hg; P < 0.001). The mean (SD) change in SitDBP at 8 weeks was significantly greater with A/L/C (-8.0 [0.6] mm Hg) than with A/L (-3.6 [0.6] mm Hg) (P < .001). In terms of the mean (SD) change in SitDBP at 2 weeks compared with baseline, A/L/C (-5.9 [0.5] mm Hg) was statistically different from A/L (-2.9 [0.5] mm Hg) (P < .001). Mean (SD) SitSBP change from baseline to week 2 was -13.2 (0.9) and -5.5 (0.9) in the A/L/C and A/L groups, respectively, with a statistically significant blood pressure-lowering effect (P < 0.001). The number of participants who achieved target blood pressure at week 8 was significantly higher in the A/L/C group (93 patients [55.7%]) than in the A/L group (48 [29.8%]) (P < 0.001). Adverse drug reactions were observed in 23 patients (7.0%), and the incidence of dizziness was significantly higher in the A/L/C group than in the A/L group (4.8% vs 0.6%, P = 0.037) There were no serious adverse events associated with the study drugs. Implications. The results of this study suggest that A/L/C had a significantly increased blood pressure-lowering efficacy compared with that of A/L and had a good safety profile.

96;29180454;Effect of Sacubitril/Valsartan on Exercise-Induced Lipid Metabolism in Patients With Obesity and Hypertension.;Sacubitril/valsartan (LCZ696), a novel angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor, was recently approved for the treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Neprilysin degrades several peptides that modulate lipid metabolism, including natriuretic peptides. In this study, we investigated the effects of 8 weeks' treatment with sacubitril/valsartan on whole-body and adipose tissue lipolysis and lipid oxidation during defined physical exercise compared with the metabolically neutral comparator amlodipine. This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel-group study enrolling subjects with abdominal obesity and moderate hypertension (mean sitting systolic blood pressure ≥130-180 mm Hg). Lipolysis during rest and exercise was assessed by microdialysis and [1,1,2,3,3-2H]-glycerol tracer kinetics. Energy expenditure and substrate oxidation were measured simultaneously using indirect calorimetry. Plasma nonesterified fatty acids, glycerol, insulin, glucose, adrenaline and noradrenaline concentrations, blood pressure, and heart rate were also determined. Exercise elevated plasma glycerol, free fatty acids, and interstitial glycerol concentrations and increased the rate of glycerol appearance. However, exercise-induced stimulation of lipolysis was not augmented on sacubitril/valsartan treatment compared with amlodipine treatment. Furthermore, sacubitril/valsartan did not alter energy expenditure and substrate oxidation during exercise compared with amlodipine treatment. In conclusion, sacubitril/valsartan treatment for 8 weeks did not elicit clinically relevant changes in exercise-induced lipolysis or substrate oxidation in obese patients with hypertension, implying that its beneficial cardiovascular effects cannot be explained by changes in lipid metabolism during exercise.

97;29694815;Tenecteplase versus Alteplase before Thrombectomy for Ischemic Stroke.;"Background. Intravenous infusion of alteplase is used for thrombolysis before endovascular thrombectomy for ischemic stroke. Tenecteplase, which is more fibrin-specific and has longer activity than alteplase, is given as a bolus and may increase the incidence of vascular reperfusion. Methods. We randomly assigned patients with ischemic stroke who had occlusion of the internal carotid, basilar, or middle cerebral artery and who were eligible to undergo thrombectomy to receive tenecteplase (at a dose of 0.25 mg per kilogram of body weight; maximum dose, 25 mg) or alteplase (at a dose of 0.9 mg per kilogram; maximum dose, 90 mg) within 4.5 hours after symptom onset. The primary outcome was reperfusion of greater than 50% of the involved ischemic territory or an absence of retrievable thrombus at the time of the initial angiographic assessment. Noninferiority of tenecteplase was tested, followed by superiority. Secondary outcomes included the modified Rankin scale score (on a scale from 0 [no neurologic deficit] to 6 [death]) at 90 days. Safety outcomes were death and symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage. Results. Of 202 patients enrolled, 101 were assigned to receive tenecteplase and 101 to receive alteplase. The primary outcome occurred in 22% of the patients treated with tenecteplase versus 10% of those treated with alteplase (incidence difference, 12 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2 to 21; incidence ratio, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.1 to 4.4; P=0.002 for noninferiority; P=0.03 for superiority). Tenecteplase resulted in a better 90-day functional outcome than alteplase (median modified Rankin scale score, 2 vs. 3; common odds ratio, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.0 to 2.8; P=0.04). Symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage occurred in 1% of the patients in each group. Conclusions. Tenecteplase before thrombectomy was associated with a higher incidence of reperfusion and better functional outcome than alteplase among patients with ischemic stroke treated within 4.5 hours after symptom onset.

98;31237645;Effect of P2Y12 Inhibitor Monotherapy vs Dual Antiplatelet Therapy on Cardiovascular Events in Patients Undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Intervention: The SMART-CHOICE Randomized Clinical Trial.;"Importance. Data on P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy after short-duration dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention are limited. Objective. To determine whether P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy after 3 months of DAPT is noninferior to 12 months of DAPT in patients undergoing PCI. Design, setting, and participants. The SMART-CHOICE trial was an open-label, noninferiority, randomized study that was conducted in 33 hospitals in Korea and included 2993 patients undergoing PCI with drug-eluting stents. Enrollment began March 18, 2014, and follow-up was completed July 19, 2018. Interventions. Patients were randomly assigned to receive aspirin plus a P2Y12 inhibitor for 3 months and thereafter P2Y12 inhibitor alone (n = 1495) or DAPT for 12 months (n = 1498). Main outcomes and measures. The primary end point was major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (a composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, or stroke) at 12 months after the index procedure. Secondary end points included the components of the primary end point and bleeding defined as Bleeding Academic Research Consortium type 2 to 5. The noninferiority margin was 1.8%. Results. Among 2993 patients who were randomized (mean age, 64 years; 795 women [26.6%]), 2912 (97.3%) completed the trial. Adherence to the study protocol was 79.3% of the P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy group and 95.2% of the DAPT group. At 12 months, major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events occurred in 42 patients in the P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy group and in 36 patients in the DAPT group (2.9% vs 2.5%; difference, 0.4% [1-sided 95% CI, -∞% to 1.3%]; P = .007 for noninferiority). There were no significant differences in all-cause death (21 [1.4%] vs 18 [1.2%]; hazard ratio [HR], 1.18; 95% CI, 0.63-2.21; P = .61), myocardial infarction (11 [0.8%] vs 17 [1.2%]; HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.31-1.40; P = .28), or stroke (11 [0.8%] vs 5 [0.3%]; HR, 2.23; 95% CI, 0.78-6.43; P = .14) between the 2 groups. The rate of bleeding was significantly lower in the P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy group than in the DAPT group (2.0% vs 3.4%; HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.36-0.92; P = .02). Conclusions and relevance. Among patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention, P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy after 3 months of DAPT compared with prolonged DAPT resulted in noninferior rates of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events. Because of limitations in the study population and adherence, further research is needed in other populations. Trial registration.

99;31416531;Antenatal Therapy for Fetal Supraventricular Tachyarrhythmias: Multicenter Trial.;"Background. Standardized treatment of fetal tachyarrhythmia has not been established. Objectives. This study sought to evaluate the safety and efficacy of protocol-defined transplacental treatment for fetal supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and atrial flutter (AFL). Methods. In this multicenter, single-arm trial, protocol-defined transplacental treatment using digoxin, sotalol, and flecainide was performed for singleton pregnancies from 22 to <37 weeks of gestation with sustained fetal SVT or AFL ≥180 beats/min. The primary endpoint was resolution of fetal tachyarrhythmia. Secondary endpoints were fetal death, pre-term birth, and neonatal arrhythmia. Adverse events (AEs) were also assessed. Results. A total of 50 patients were enrolled at 15 institutions in Japan from 2010 to 2017; short ventriculoatrial (VA) SVT (n = 17), long VA SVT (n = 4), and AFL (n = 29). One patient with AFL was excluded because of withdrawal of consent. Fetal tachyarrhythmia resolved in 89.8% (44 of 49) of cases overall and in 75.0% (3 of 4) of cases of fetal hydrops. Pre-term births occurred in 20.4% (10 of 49) of patients. Maternal AEs were observed in 78.0% (39 of 50) of patients. Serious AEs occurred in 1 mother and 4 fetuses, thus resulting in discontinuation of protocol treatment in 4 patients. Two fetal deaths occurred, mainly caused by heart failure. Neonatal tachyarrhythmia was observed in 31.9% (15 of 47) of neonates within 2 weeks after birth. Conclusions. Protocol-defined transplacental treatment for fetal SVT and AFL was effective and tolerable in 90% of patients. However, it should be kept in mind that serious AEs may take place in fetuses and that tachyarrhythmias may recur within the first 2 weeks after birth.";Circulatory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train
100;9742977;Effect of intensive blood-glucose control with metformin on complications in overweight patients with type 2 diabetes (UKPDS 34). UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) Group.;"Background In patients with type 2 diabetes, intensive blood-glucose control with insulin or sulphonylurea therapy decreases progression of microvascular disease and may also reduce the risk of heart attacks. This study investigated whether intensive glucose control with metformin has any specific advantage or disadvantage. Methods Of 4075 patients recruited to UKPDS in 15 centres, 1704 overweight (>120% ideal bodyweight) patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes, mean age 53 years, had raised fasting plasma glucose (FPG; 6.1-15.0 mmol/L) without hyperglycaemic symptoms after 3 months' initial diet. 753 were included in a randomised controlled trial, median duration 10.7 years, of conventional policy, primarily with diet alone (n=411) versus intensive blood-glucose control policy with metformin, aiming for FPG below 6 mmol/L (n=342). A secondary analysis compared the 342 patients allocated metformin with 951 overweight patients allocated intensive blood-glucose control with chlorpropamide (n=265), glibenclamide (n=277), or insulin (n=409). The primary outcome measures were aggregates of any diabetes-related clinical endpoint, diabetes-related death, and all-cause mortality. In a supplementary randomised controlled trial, 537 non-overweight and overweight patients, mean age 59 years, who were already on maximum sulphonylurea therapy but had raised FPG (6.1-15.0 mmol/L) were allocated continuing sulphonylurea therapy alone (n=269) or addition of metformin (n=268). Findings Median glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) was 7.4% in the metformin group compared with 8.0% in the conventional group. Patients allocated metformin, compared with the conventional group, had risk reductions of 32% (95% CI 13-47, p=0.002) for any diabetes-related endpoint, 42% for diabetes-related death (9-63, p=0.017), and 36% for all-cause mortality (9-55, p=0.011). Among patients allocated intensive blood-glucose control, metformin showed a greater effect than chlorpropamide, glibenclamide, or insulin for any diabetes-related endpoint (p=0.0034), all-cause mortality (p=0.021), and stroke (p=0.032). Early addition of metformin in sulphonylurea-treated patients was associated with an increased risk of diabetes-related death (96% increased risk [95% CI 2-275], p=0.039) compared with continued sulphonylurea alone. A combined analysis of the main and supplementary studies showed fewer metformin-allocated patients having diabetes-related endpoints (risk reduction 19% [2-33], p=0.033). Epidemiological assessment of the possible association of death from diabetes-related causes with the concurrent therapy of diabetes in 4416 patients did not show an increased risk in diabetes-related death in patients treated with a combination of sulphonylurea and metformin (risk reduction 5% [-33 to 32], p=0.78). Interpretation Since intensive glucose control with metformin appears to decrease the risk of diabetes-related endpoints in overweight diabetic patients, and is associated with less weight gain and fewer hypoglycaemic attacks than are insulin and sulphonylureas, it may be the first-line pharmacological therapy of choice in these patients.";Endocrine, nutritional or metabolic diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train
101;12749511;Glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus switched from twice-daily immediate-release metformin to a once-daily extended-release formulation.;"Background The extended-release formulation of metformin (MXR) prolongs drug absorption in the upper gastrointestinal tract and permits once-daily dosing in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. This newer formulation may enhance patient compliance with oral therapy and improve long-term control of diabetes compared with the conventional immediate-release formulation of metformin (MIR). Objective The goal of this study was to determine the effects on glycemic control of a switch to MXR therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes currently treated with MIR. Methods This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study in patients with established type 2 diabetes. Eligible patients were to have a glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) value < or = 8.5% and mean fasting plasma glucose (FPG) concentrations < or = 200 mg/dL while receiving MIR 500 mg BID for at least 8 weeks. After a 2-week, single-blind lead-in period, patients were randomly assigned to receive MXR 1000 or 1500 mg QD for 24 weeks or to continue MIR 500 mg BID for 24 weeks. The primary efficacy variable was change in HbA1c from baseline to week 12. Other variables included change in FPG levels; change in HbA1c; distribution of HbA1c values; mean daily blood glucose concentrations (self-monitored); levels of fructosamine, serum insulin, and lipids; and body weight. Results Two hundred seventeen patients were randomized to treatment. The mean change from baseline in HbA1c values at weeks 12 and 24 were small and similar in the 3 treatment groups. At week 12, the mean change from baseline in HbA1c was 0.15% for MIR, 0.23% for MXR 1000 mg, and 0.04% for MXR 1500 mg. The corresponding mean changes at week 24 were 0.06%, 0.25%, and 0.14%.

102;14969649;Glycemic control with glyburide/metformin tablets in combination with rosiglitazone in patients with type 2 diabetes: a randomized, double-blind trial.;Purpose To assess the efficacy and safety of adding rosiglitazone to an established regimen of glyburide/metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes who had not achieved adequate glycemic control (glycosylated hemoglobin [HbA1C] levels >7.0% and < or =10.0%). Methods Following an open-label, lead-in phase to optimize the dosing of glyburide/metformin tablets, 365 patients randomly received additive therapy comprising rosiglitazone (4 mg once daily) or placebo for 24 weeks. Based on glycemic response, rosiglitazone dose was maintained or increased to 4 mg twice daily. Glyburide/metformin dose was maintained or reduced by 2.5/500 mg for symptomatic hypoglycemia. The primary endpoint was the change in HbA1C level from baseline to week 24. The proportions of patients achieving HbA1C levels <7% and a fasting plasma glucose level <126 mg/dL were also assessed. Results After 24 weeks, therapy with glyburide/metformin plus rosiglitazone resulted in a greater reduction in HbA1C levels (-1.0%, P<0.001) compared with combination therapy that included placebo, and in a larger proportion of patients (42% vs. 14%) who attained levels <7%. The difference in fasting plasma glucose levels between groups was -48 mg/dL (P<0.001), favoring glyburide/metformin plus rosiglitazone. The adverse event profile in the rosiglitazone-treated group included mild-to-moderate edema (8%), hypoglycemia (22%), and weight gain of 3 kg. No patient experienced hypoglycemia requiring third-party assistance. Conclusion In patients with inadequate glycemic control despite established glyburide/metformin therapy, the addition of rosiglitazone improves glycemic control, allowing more patients to achieve an HbA1C level <7% and perhaps delaying the need for insulin treatment.;Endocrine, nutritional or metabolic diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train

Methods Enrolled patients (n = 252) were adults having Type 2 diabetes for at least 1 year, with HbA(1c) values > 7.0% after previous monotherapy (sulphonylurea or metformin, >/= 50% maximal dose). Prior therapy was withdrawn for 2 weeks, followed by randomization to repaglinide, rosiglitazone, or repaglinide/rosiglitazone. Study treatments were initiated with a 12-week dose optimization period (doses optimized according to labelling), followed by a 12-week maintenance period. Efficacy endpoints were changes in HbA(1c) values (primary) or fasting plasma glucose values (secondary). Results Baseline HbA(1c) values were comparable (9.3% for repaglinide, 9.0% for rosiglitazone, 9.1% for combination). Mean changes in HbA(1c) values at the end of treatment were greater for repaglinide/rosiglitazone therapy (-1.43%) than for repaglinide (-0.17%) or rosiglitazone (-0.56%) monotherapy. Reductions of fasting plasma glucose values were also greater for combination therapy (-5.2 mmol/l, -94 mg/dl) than for repaglinide monotherapy (-3.0 mmol/l, -54 mg/dl) or rosiglitazone monotherapy (-3.7 mmol/l, -67 mg/dl). Minor hypoglycaemic events occurred in 9% of combination therapy patients, vs. 6% for repaglinide and 2% for rosiglitazone. Individual weight gains for combination therapy were correlated to HbA(1c) response. Conclusions The combination therapy regimen was well tolerated.

104;16448519;Metformin-glibenclamide versus metformin plus rosiglitazone in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin monotherapy.;"Aim This double-blind study evaluated the efficacy and safety of metformin-glibenclamide tablets vs. metformin plus rosiglitazone therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin monotherapy. Subjects and methods After an open-label, metformin lead-in phase, 318 patients were randomly assigned to treatment based on metformin-glibenclamide 500/2.5 mg tablets (initial daily dose 1000/5 mg) or metformin 500 mg plus rosiglitazone 4 mg (initial daily dose 1000-2000 mg + 4 mg, depending on previous treatment) for 24 weeks. Doses were titrated to achieve the therapeutic glycaemic target. The primary efficacy variable was the change in HbA1C. Results At week 24, metformin-glibenclamide tablets resulted in significantly greater reductions in HbA1C (-1.5%) and fasting plasma glucose [-2.6 mmol/l (-46 mg/dl)] than metformin plus rosiglitazone [-1.1%, p < 0.001; -2 mmol/l (-36 mg/dl), p = 0.03]. More patients receiving metformin-glibenclamide attained HbA1C <7.0% than did those in the metformin plus rosiglitazone group (60 vs. 47%) and had fasting plasma glucose levels <7 mmol/l (<126 mg/dl) by week 24 (34 vs. 25%). Both treatments were well tolerated. Frequency of adverse gastrointestinal events was comparable between groups. Four per cent of patients receiving metformin-glibenclamide withdrew because of symptomatic hypoglycaemia contrasted with 3% of patients receiving metformin plus rosiglitazone who withdrew because of persistent hyperglycaemia. Hypoglycaemic events were mild or moderate in intensity and were easily self-managed. Conclusions Metformin-glibenclamide tablets resulted in significantly greater reductions in HbA1C and fasting plasma glucose compared with metformin plus rosiglitazone in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin monotherapy.";Endocrine, nutritional or metabolic diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train
105;16448522;Double-blind, randomized, multicentre study of the efficacy and safety of gliclazide-modified release in the treatment of Chinese type 2 diabetic patients.;"Background and aim Gliclazide-modified release (gliclazide MR) is a new formulation of the sulfonylurea gliclazide designed for once-daily administration. The hydrophilic matrix of hypromellose-based polymer in the new formulation induces a progressive drug release, which parallels the 24-h glycaemic profile in type 2 diabetic patients. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of gliclazide MR (once-daily administration) versus gliclazide (twice-daily administration) in Chinese type 2 diabetic patients. Materials and methods Sixty-three type 2 diabetic Chinese patients who had been on diet control alone or on treatment with metformin or on low dose of sulfonylurea were randomized to either gliclazide MR taken once daily or gliclazide taken twice daily. Dosage of metformin was maintained throughout the study, and the sulfonylurea was stopped. The dose of gliclazide MR was increased at 1-month intervals from 30 mg to 120 mg, while that of gliclazide from 80 mg to 320 mg until metabolic control was achieved [fasting plasma glucose (FPG) < or = 7.7 mmol/l] or the maximum dose reached. Efficacy was mainly evaluated by levels of haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and FPG. Results The mean baseline characteristics of the full analysis set 1 (FAS1) (HbA1c, n = 58) and the FAS2 (FPG, n = 61) were comparable in both groups. The levels of HbA1c decreased similarly in both groups over the treatment period: -1.6 +/- 1.6% (p < 0.001) on gliclazide MR (n = 31) and -1.6 +/- 1.4% (p < 0.001) on gliclazide (n = 27). Decrease in HbA1c was observed irrespective of pre-existing therapy for diabetes: -2.3 +/- 1.5% for patients on diet alone; -0.6 +/- 1.3% for patients switched from sulfonylurea to study drug and -1.4 +/- 0.8% for patients on metformin in combination with study drug. FPG decreased significantly from 177.5 +/- 63.5 to 136.7 +/- 42.2 (p < 0.001, n = 32) on gliclazide MR and not significant from 188.2 +/- 62.6 to 163.7 +/- 67.9 (p = 0.059, n = 29) on gliclazide. Both treatments were very well tolerated with no major hypoglycaemic episodes requiring external assistance; only three patients experienced mild hypoglycaemic episodes. Conclusions Once-daily gliclazide MR showed a better trend in improving blood glucose control in comparison with gliclazide in type 2 diabetic Chinese patients irrespective of the pre-existing anti-diabetic treatment. The safety profiles of gliclazide MR and gliclazide were similar with a small number of patients having reported hypoglycaemic episodes. Once-daily dosing with gliclazide MR should improve patient compliance, an important factor in long-term glycaemic control.";Endocrine, nutritional or metabolic diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train
106;16842480;Comparison of nateglinide and gliclazide in combination with metformin, for treatment of patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus inadequately controlled on maximum doses of metformin alone.;"Aim To compare the effects of nateglinide plus metformin with gliclazide plus metformin on glycaemic control in patients with Type 2 diabetes. Methods Double-blind, double-dummy, parallel group, randomized, multicentre study over 24 weeks. Patients with inadequate glucose control on maximal doses of metformin were randomized to additionally receive nateglinide (n = 133) or gliclazide (n = 129). Changes from baseline in HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and mealtime glucose and insulin excursions were examined. Results HbA1c was significantly (P < 0.001) decreased from baseline in both treatment groups (mean changes: nateglinide -0.41%, gliclazide -0.57%), but with no significant difference between treatments. Proportions of patients achieving a reduction of HbA1c >or= 0.5% or an end point HbA1c < 7% were also similar (nateglinide 58.1%, gliclazide 60.2%). Changes from baseline in FPG were similarly significant in both treatment groups (nateglinide -0.63, gliclazide -0.82 mmol/l). Reduction from baseline in maximum postprandial glucose excursion were significant in the nateglinide group only (nateglinide -0.71, gliclazide -0.10 mmol/l; P = 0.037 for difference). Postprandial insulin levels were significantly higher with nateglinide compared with gliclazide. The overall rate of hypoglycaemia events was similar in the nateglinide group compared with the gliclazide group. Conclusions No significant difference was seen between nateglinide plus metformin and gliclazide plus metformin in terms of HbA1c. However, the nateglinide combination demonstrated better postprandial glucose control.";Endocrine, nutritional or metabolic diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train
107;17130197;Efficacy and safety of the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor sitagliptin added to ongoing metformin therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin alone.;Objective The efficacy and safety of the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, sitagliptin, added to ongoing metformin therapy, were assessed in patients with type 2 diabetes who had inadequate glycemic control (HbA(1c) [A1C] >or=7 and <or=10%) with metformin alone. Research design and methods After a screening diet/exercise run-in period, a metformin dose titration/stabilization period, and a 2-week, single-blind, placebo run-in period, 701 patients, aged 19-78 years, with mild to moderate hyperglycemia (mean A1C 8.0%) receiving ongoing metformin (>or=1,500 mg/day) were randomly assigned to receive the addition of placebo or sitagliptin 100 mg once-daily in a 1:2 ratio for 24 weeks. Patients exceeding specific glycemic limits were provided rescue therapy (pioglitazone) until the end of the study. The efficacy analyses were based on an all-patients-treated population using an ANCOVA and excluded data obtained after glycemic rescue. Results At week 24, sitagliptin treatment led to significant reductions compared with placebo in A1C (-0.65%), fasting plasma glucose, and 2-h postmeal glucose. Fasting insulin, fasting C-peptide, fasting proinsulin-to-insulin ratio, postmeal insulin and C-peptide areas under the curve (AUCs), postmeal insulin AUC-to-glucose AUC ratio, homeostasis model assessment of beta-cell function, and quantitative insulin sensitivity check index were significantly improved with sitagliptin relative to placebo. A significantly greater proportion of patients achieved an A1C <7% with sitagliptin (47.0%) than with placebo (18.3%). There was no increased risk of hypoglycemia or gastrointestinal adverse experiences with sitagliptin compared with placebo. Body weight decreased similarly with sitagliptin and placebo.

108;17714824;Safety and efficacy of repaglinide in combination with metformin and bedtime NPH insulin as an insulin treatment regimen in type 2 diabetes.;Objective To evaluate the efficacy and safety of the association of repaglinide, metformin and bedtime NPH insulin compared to two classic regimens: metformin plus NPH and two doses of NPH in patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes despite two or more oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs). Patients and methods Random, parallel and open study of 24 weeks with 37 patients randomized into three therapeutic groups: group A (n=12) (repaglinide/metformin/NPH), group B (n=12) (metformin/NPH) and group C (n=13) (NPH/NPH). The insulin was adjusted in the visits to obtain a basal blood glucose <110 mg/dl. The endpoint criteria included HbA1c, blood glucose profile, hypoglycemias and body weight. Results At the end of the study, group A presented HbA1c (mean+/-standard deviation) 7.2+/-0.7%, which was significantly less than B (8.8+/-0.1%) and C (8.4+/-1.2%). In terms of absolute reduction, there were only differences (p=0.01) between group A (-2.4+/-1.1%) and B (-0.7+/-1.2%). Group A presented lower postprandial blood glucose values (p<0.01). Nor were there any significant differences in weight gain and incidence of hypoglycemia. Conclusions The combination of repaglinide, metformin and bedtime NPH is safe and effective and it provides better postprandial blood glucose control. The association of metformin and a dose of NPH does not obtain suitable control in patients with a long evolution who have already received two or more OADs.;Endocrine, nutritional or metabolic diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train
109;17919762;Six-month multicentric, open-label, randomized trial of twice-daily injections of biphasic insulin aspart 30 versus multiple daily injections of insulin aspart in Japanese type 2 diabetic patients (JDDM 11).;To evaluate glycemic control using convenience-oriented biphasic insulin analog compared with intensified insulin therapy, we conducted a 6-month multicentric, open-label, randomized trial in Japanese insulin-naive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. A total of 160 adult patients at 19 centers were randomized into two groups: those who received twice-daily injections of biphasic insulin aspart 30 and those on three-times-daily injections of insulin aspart with or without NPH insulin (multiple daily injections). At 6 months, mean HbA(1c) decreased by approximately 2.5% in both groups. Reduction of HbA(1c) on both regimens was better in patients whose prior therapy before starting the study was only diet and exercise (-5.0%) than in patients who were previously taking oral antidiabetic agents (-1.0%). No incidence of major hypoglycemia was observed in either regimen. These results suggest that convenience-oriented insulin therapy using biphasic insulin analog is as useful as intensified insulin therapy with insulin analog for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus over 6 months. Furthermore, early induction of insulin therapy in individuals hitherto using only diet and exercise may provide good glycemic control. This study suggests that convenience-oriented biphasic insulin aspart 30 might be a useful option for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, especially for insulin-naive patients over 6 months, although it should be changed to another regimen when expected efficacy is not obtained.;Endocrine, nutritional or metabolic diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train
110;18204830;A randomised, 52-week, treat-to-target trial comparing insulin detemir with insulin glargine when administered as add-on to glucose-lowering drugs in insulin-naive people with type 2 diabetes.;"Aims/hypothesis This 52-week multinational, randomised, open-label, parallel-group, non-inferiority trial compared clinical outcomes following supplementation of oral glucose-lowering drugs with basal insulin analogues detemir and glargine in type 2 diabetic patients. Methods Insulin-naive adults (n=582, HbA(1c) 7.5-10.0%, BMI <or= 40.0 kg/m(2)) were randomised 1:1 to receive insulin detemir or glargine once daily (evening) actively titrated to target fasting plasma glucose (FPG) <or= 6.0 mmol/l. An additional morning insulin detemir dose was permitted if pre-dinner plasma glucose (PG) was >7.0 mmol/l after achieving FPG <7.0 mmol/l. Due to labelling restrictions, no second glargine dose was allowed. Results Baseline HbA(1c) decreased from 8.6 to 7.2 and 7.1% (NS) with detemir and glargine, respectively. FPG improved from 10.8 to 7.1 and 7.0 mmol/l (NS), respectively. With detemir, 45% of participants completed the study on once daily dosing and 55% on twice daily dosing, with no difference in HbA(1c). Overall, 52% of participants achieved HbA(1c) <or= 7.0%: 33% (detemir) and 35% (glargine) without hypoglycaemia. Within-participant variability for self-monitored FPG and pre-dinner PG did not differ by insulin treatment, nor did the relative risk of overall or nocturnal hypoglycaemia. Modest reductions in weight gain were seen with detemir vs glargine in completers (3.0 vs 3.9 kg, p=0.01) and in the intention-to-treat population (2.7 vs 3.5 kg, p=0.03), primarily related to completers on once-daily detemir. Mean daily detemir dose was higher (0.78 U/kg [0.52 with once daily dosing, 1.00 U/kg with twice daily dosing]) than glargine (0.44 IU/kg). Injection site reactions were more frequent with detemir (4.5 vs 1.4%). Conclusions/interpretation Supplementation of oral agents with detemir or glargine achieves clinically important improvements in glycaemic control with low risk of hypoglycaemia. Non-inferiority was demonstrated for detemir using higher insulin doses (mainly patients on twice daily dosing); weight gain was somewhat reduced with once daily insulin detemir.";Endocrine, nutritional or metabolic diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train
111;18284434;Effects of vildagliptin on glucose control in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with a sulphonylurea.;Aim To compare the efficacy and tolerability of vildagliptin vs. placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who are inadequately controlled [haemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) 7.5 to 11%] with prior sulphonylurea (SU) monotherapy. Methods This 24-week, multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study assessed the effects of the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor vildagliptin (50 mg given once or twice daily) vs. placebo added to glimepiride (4 mg once daily) in 515 patients with T2DM. Adjusted mean changes from baseline to end-point (AMDelta) in HbA(1c), fasting plasma glucose, fasting lipids and body weight were compared by analysis of covariance. Results The between-group difference (vildagliptin - placebo) in AMDelta HbA(1c) was -0.6 +/- 0.1% in patients receiving vildagliptin 50 mg daily and -0.7 +/- 0.1% in those receiving 100 mg daily (p < 0.001 vs. placebo for both). Greater efficacy was seen in patients > or =65 years of age (-0.7 +/- 0.1% and -0.8 +/- 0.2% for 50 and 100 mg daily respectively) and in patients with baseline HbA(1c) > 9% (Delta = -1.0 +/- 0.2% and -0.9 +/- 0.2% for 50 and 100 mg daily respectively). Relative to placebo, patients receiving vildagliptin also had improvements in beta-cell function and postprandial glucose, with small changes in fasting lipids and body weight. The incidences of adverse events (AEs) (67.1, 66.3 and 64.2%) and serious AEs (2.9, 2.4 and 5.1%) were similar in patients receiving 50 mg vildagliptin, 100 mg vildagliptin or placebo respectively. The incidence of hypoglycaemic events was low but slightly higher in the group receiving vildagliptin 100 mg (3.6%) than in the group receiving vildagliptin 50 mg (1.2%) or placebo (0.6%). Conclusions In patients with T2DM inadequately controlled with prior SU monotherapy, addition of vildagliptin (50 or 100 mg daily) to glimepiride (4 mg once daily) improves glycaemic control and is well tolerated. Addition of vildagliptin 50 mg daily to SU monotherapy may be a particularly attractive therapy in elderly patients.;Endocrine, nutritional or metabolic diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train
112;18374840;Once-daily basal insulin glargine versus thrice-daily prandial insulin lispro in people with type 2 diabetes on oral hypoglycaemic agents (APOLLO): an open randomised controlled trial.;"Background As type 2 diabetes mellitus progresses, oral hypoglycaemic agents often fail to maintain blood glucose control and insulin is needed. We investigated whether the addition of once-daily insulin glargine is non-inferior to three-times daily prandial insulin lispro in overall glycaemic control in adults with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus taking oral hypoglycaemic agents. Methods In the 44-week, parallel, open study that was undertaken in 69 study sites across Europe and Australia, 418 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus that was inadequately controlled by oral hypoglycaemic agents were randomly assigned to either insulin glargine taken once daily at the same time every day or to insulin lispro administered three times per day. The primary objective was to compare the change in haemoglobin A(1c) from baseline to endpoint (week 44) between the two regimens. Randomisation was done with a central randomisation service. Analysis was per protocol. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00311818. Findings 205 patients were randomly assigned to insulin glargine and 210 to insulin lispro. Mean haemoglobin A(1c) decrease in the insulin glargine group was -1.7% (from 8.7% [SD 1.0] to 7.0% [0.7]) and -1.9% in the insulin lispro group (from 8.7% [1.0] to 6.8% [0.9]), which was within the predefined limit of 0.4% for non-inferiority (difference=0.157; 95% Cl -0.008 to 0.322). 106 (57%) patients reached haemoglobin A(1c) of 7% or less in the glargine group and 131 (69%) in the lispro group. In the glargine group, the fall in mean fasting blood glucose (-4.3 [SD 2.3] mmol/L vs -1.8 [2.3] mmol/L; p<0.0001) and nocturnal blood glucose (-3.3 [2.8] mmol/L vs -2.6 [2.9] mmol/L; p=0.0041) was better than it was in the insulin lispro group, whereas insulin lispro better controlled postprandial blood glucose throughout the day (p<0.0001). The incidence of hypoglycaemic events was less with insulin glargine than with lispro (5.2 [95% CI 1.9-8.9] vs 24.0 [21-28] events per patient per year; p<0.0001). Respective mean weight gains were 3.01 (SD 4.33) kg and 3.54 (4.48) kg. The improvement of treatment satisfaction was greater for insulin glargine than for insulin lispro (mean difference 3.13; 95% CI 2.04-4.22). Interpretation A therapeutic regimen involving the addition of either basal or prandial insulin analogue is equally effective in lowering haemoglobin A(1c). We conclude that insulin glargine provides a simple and effective option that is more satisfactory to patients than is lispro for early initiation of insulin therapy, since it was associated with a lower risk of hypoglycaemia, fewer injections, less blood glucose self monitoring, and greater patient satisfaction than was insulin lispro.

113;18412932;The metabolic effects of once daily extended-release metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes: a multicentre study.;Aim To investigate the effects of extended-release metformin (MXR) compared with immediate-release metformin (MIR) on post-prandial glycaemic excursion, chronic glycaemia, lipid profiles, insulin resistance and islet function in type 2 diabetes. Methods A randomised, open-labelled, positive-controlled multicentre study was conducted on 150 Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes. After 2 weeks of run-in period with MIR, 150 subjects were randomised into MXR group and MIR group. The patients in MXR group were assigned to take MXR 1500 mg once daily after dinner, while the patients in MIR group were assigned to continue MIR 500 mg thrice daily after meals for 12 weeks. Standard meal tests were carried out at baseline and at the end of this study. Plasma glucose, serum insulin, HbA1c and lipid profiles were measured. Homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) was used to evaluate insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR) and islet beta-cell function index (HOMA-B). Results Either MIR or MXR modestly, but significantly decreased HbA1c levels and body mass index (BMI) after 12 weeks of treatment. However, there were no significant differences between two groups. The post-prandial glycaemia at 120 min after a standard meal in MXR group was higher than in MIR group (11.02 +/- 3.08 mmol/l vs. 9.74 +/- 2.61 mmol/l, p < 0.05). Moreover, no differences in the areas under curve of insulin release response, HOMA-B, HOMA-IR and lipid profiles were found within or between groups after 12 weeks of treatment. Conclusion The effects of once daily MXR on chronic glycaemia, BMI, lipid profiles, insulin resistance and islet function are comparable with that of thrice daily MIR in oriental population.;Endocrine, nutritional or metabolic diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train
114;18666804;Fixed-dose combination tablet of repaglinide and metformin is bioequivalent to concomitantly administered individual tablets of repaglinide and metformin : randomized, single-blind, three-period crossover study in healthy subjects.;"Background and objective Repaglinide and metformin enhance insulin secretion and decrease hepatic gluconeogenesis, respectively, and are commonly coadministered as separate formulations to treat patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. A single combination therapy tablet offers increased patient convenience and the subsequent potential for increased therapy compliance. The aim of this randomized, single-blind, three-period crossover study was to determine the bioequivalence of a fixed-dose combination (FDC) tablet of repaglinide/metformin 2 mg/500 mg versus repaglinide 2 mg and metformin 500 mg coadministered as separate formulations. Secondary objectives included a comparison of the dose proportionality of an FDC tablet of repaglinide/metformin 1 mg/500 mg and an FDC tablet of repaglinide/metformin 2 mg/500 mg, as well as the safety and tolerability of repaglinide and metformin in combination tablet therapy. Methods Healthy subjects (n = 93, age 18-45 years) were randomized to one of six possible treatment sequences (Williams design) of an FDC tablet of repaglinide/metformin 2 mg/500 mg, repaglinide 2 mg and metformin 500 mg coadministered as separate tablets and an FDC of repaglinide/metformin 1 mg/500 mg. Fifty-five subjects completed the study. Four primary pharmacokinetic endpoints (area under the plasma concentration-time curve [AUC] from time 0 hours to infinity; AUC from time 0 to 24 hours; AUC from time 0 hours to time t [the last time of measurable concentration after dosing]; and the maximum plasma concentration) were used to assess bioequivalence and dose proportionality. The safety and tolerability of repaglinide and metformin in combination tablet therapy were also evaluated. Results Both repaglinide and metformin in the combination tablet were determined to be bioequivalent to the individual tablets of repaglinide 2 mg and metformin 500 mg, as the limits of the 90% confidence interval of the mean treatment ratio for all pharmacokinetic parameters were contained within the pre-specified interval required for bioequivalence (0.8, 1.25). Additionally, an FDC tablet of repaglinide/metformin 2 mg/500 mg was determined to be dose proportional to an FDC of repaglinide/metformin 1 mg/500 mg for all analysed endpoints. No withdrawals as a result of adverse events occurred during this study. In addition, no clinically relevant abnormalities were found during physical examinations, in vital signs, ECG parameters or clinical laboratory parameters. Conclusion An FDC tablet of repaglinide/metformin 2 mg/500 mg was bioequivalent to individual tablets of repaglinide 2 mg and metformin 500 mg. Additionally, an FDC tablet of repaglinide/metformin 2 mg/500 mg was dose proportional to an FDC tablet of repaglinide/metformin 1 mg/500 mg. Finally, no unexpected safety concerns were noted with repaglinide/metformin combination tablet therapy. Our results suggest that FDC tablets of repaglinide and metformin would provide safety and efficacy comparable to that of repaglinide and metformin administered as separate formulations.";Endocrine, nutritional or metabolic diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train

In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 18-week trial, 530 patients with HbA(1c) >or=7.5% and <or=11.0% (mean baseline 8.7%) received sitagliptin 100mg once daily or placebo. Compared with placebo, sitagliptin significantly (p<0.001) reduced mean HbA(1c) (-1.0%), fasting plasma glucose (-1.7 mmol/L), and 2-h postprandial glucose (-3.1 mmol/L), and a significantly (p<0.001) greater proportion of sitagliptin-treated versus placebo-treated patients achieved HbA(1c) <7% (20.6% versus 5.3%, respectively) at study end. Efficacy of sitagliptin was demonstrated in each country. Sitagliptin was generally well-tolerated. Clinical adverse events (AEs) were reported in 23.3% and 15.2% of sitagliptin-treated and placebo-treated patients, respectively. The difference was primarily due to increased gastrointestinal AEs in the sitagliptin group, most of which were mild and resolved on study drug. Serious AEs, discontinuations due to AEs, and drug-related AEs occurred with a low incidence in both groups. No hypoglycemia was reported.

Research design and methods This 26-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial randomized 533 subjects (1:1:1) to once-daily liraglutide (1.2 or 1.8 mg) or liraglutide placebo in combination with metformin (1 g twice daily) and rosiglitazone (4 mg twice daily). Subjects had type 2 diabetes, A1C 7-11% (previous oral antidiabetes drug [OAD] monotherapy >or=3 months) or 7-10% (previous OAD combination therapy >or=3 months), and BMI <or=45 kg/m(2). Results Mean A1C values decreased significantly more in the liraglutide groups versus placebo (mean +/- SE -1.5 +/- 0.1% for both 1.2 and 1.8 mg liraglutide and -0.5 +/- 0.1% for placebo). Fasting plasma glucose decreased by 40, 44, and 8 mg/dl for 1.2 and 1.8 mg and placebo, respectively, and 90-min postprandial glucose decreased by 47, 49, and 14 mg/dl, respectively (P < 0.001 for all liraglutide groups vs. placebo). Dose-dependent weight loss occurred with 1.2 and 1.8 mg liraglutide (1.0 +/- 0.3 and 2.0 +/- 0.3 kg, respectively) (P < 0.0001) compared with weight gain with placebo (0.6 +/- 0.3 kg). Systolic blood pressure decreased by 6.7, 5.6, and 1.1 mmHg with 1.2 and 1.8 mg liraglutide and placebo, respectively. Significant increases in C-peptide and homeostasis model assessment of beta-cell function and significant decreases in the proinsulin-to-insulin ratio occurred with liraglutide versus placebo. Minor hypoglycemia occurred more frequently with liraglutide, but there was no major hypoglycemia. Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common with liraglutide, but most occurred early and were transient.

Research design and methods In a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study, 493 patients 18-80 years old with inadequate glycemic control after stabilization (i.e., glycosylated hemoglobin [HbA(1c)] 7.0-10.0%) despite ongoing treatment with a TZD were randomly assigned (2:2:1) to treatment with pioglitazone plus alogliptin 12.5 mg, alogliptin 25 mg or placebo once daily. Concomitant therapy with metformin or sulfonylurea at prestudy doses was permitted. Main outcome measures The primary efficacy endpoint was change in HbA(1c) from baseline to Week 26. Secondary endpoints included changes in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and body weight, and incidences of marked hyperglycemia (FPG > or = 200 mg/dL [11.10 mmol/L]) and rescue for hyperglycemia. Results Least squares (LS) mean change in HbA(1c) was significantly (p < 0.001) greater for alogliptin 12.5 mg (-0.66%) or 25 mg (-0.80%) than for placebo (-0.19%). A significantly (p < or = 0.016) larger proportion of patients achieved HbA(1c) < or = 7% with alogliptin 12.5 mg (44.2%) or 25 mg (49.2%) than with placebo (34.0%). LS mean decreases in FPG were significantly (p = 0.003) greater with alogliptin 12.5 mg (-19.7 mg/dL [-1.09 mmol/L]) or 25 mg (-19.9 mg/dL [-1.10 mmol/L]) than with placebo (-5.7 mg/dL [-0.32 mmol/L]). The percentage of patients with marked hyperglycemia was significantly (p < 0.001) lower for alogliptin (< or =25.0%) than placebo (44.3%). The incidences of overall adverse events and hypoglycemia were similar across treatment groups, but cardiac events occurred more often with active treatment than placebo. Conclusions Addition of alogliptin to pioglitazone therapy significantly improved glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes and was generally well tolerated.

The aim of our study was to evaluate the effects of exenatide compared to glibenclamide on body weight, glycemic control, beta-cell function, insulin resistance, and inflammatory state in patients with diabetes. Methods One hundred twenty-eight patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving therapy with metformin were randomized to take exenatide 5 microg twice a day or glibenclamide 2.5 mg three times a day and titrated to exenatide 10 microg twice a day or glibenclamide 5 mg three times a day. We evaluated body weight, body mass index (BMI), glycated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), postprandial plasma glucose (PPG), fasting plasma insulin (FPI), homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index, homeostasis model assessment beta-cell function (HOMA-beta) index, plasma proinsulin (PPr), PPr/FPI ratio, resistin, retinol binding protein-4 (RBP-4), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (Hs-CRP) at baseline and after 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Results Body weight and BMI decreased with exenatide and increased with glibenclamide. A similar improvement of HbA(1c), FPG, and PPG was obtained in both groups, whereas FPI decreased with exenatide and increased with glibenclamide. The HOMA-IR index decreased and the HOMA-beta index increased with exenatide but not with glibenclamide. A decrease of PPr was reported in both groups, but only glibenclamide decreased the PPr/FPI ratio. Resistin and RBP-4 decreased with exenatide and increased with glibenclamide. A decrease of Hs-CRP was obtained with exenatide, whereas no variations were observed with glibenclamide. Conclusions Both exenatide and glibenclamide gave a similar improvement of glycemic control, but only exenatide gave improvements of insulin resistance and beta-cell function, giving also a decrease of body weight and of inflammatory state.;Endocrine, nutritional or metabolic diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train
119;20417856;Liraglutide versus sitagliptin for patients with type 2 diabetes who did not have adequate glycaemic control with metformin: a 26-week, randomised, parallel-group, open-label trial.;"Background Agonists of the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor provide pharmacological levels of GLP-1 activity, whereas dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors increase concentrations of endogenous GLP-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of the human GLP-1 analogue liraglutide versus the DPP-4 inhibitor sitagliptin, as adjunct treatments to metformin, in individuals with type 2 diabetes who did not achieve adequate glycaemic control with metformin alone. Methods In this parallel-group, open-label trial, participants (aged 18-80 years) with type 2 diabetes mellitus who had inadequate glycaemic control (glycosylated haemoglobin [HbA(1c)] 7.5-10.0%) on metformin (>or=1500 mg daily for >or=3 months) were enrolled and treated at office-based sites in Europe, the USA, and Canada. Participants were randomly allocated to receive 26 weeks' treatment with 1.2 mg (n=225) or 1.8 mg (n=221) subcutaneous liraglutide once daily, or 100 mg oral sitagliptin once daily (n=219). The primary endpoint was change in HbA(1c) from baseline to week 26. The efficacy of liraglutide versus sitagliptin was assessed hierarchically by a non-inferiority comparison, with a margin of 0.4%, followed by a superiority comparison. Analyses were done on the full analysis set with missing values imputed by last observation carried forward; seven patients assigned to liraglutide did not receive treatment and thus did not meet criteria for inclusion in the full analysis set. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00700817. Findings Greater lowering of mean HbA(1c) (8.5% at baseline) was achieved with 1.8 mg liraglutide (-1.50%, 95% CI -1.63 to -1.37, n=218) and 1.2 mg liraglutide (-1.24%, -1.37 to -1.11, n=221) than with sitagliptin (-0.90%, -1.03 to -0.77, n=219). Estimated mean treatment differences for liraglutide versus sitagliptin were -0.60% (95% CI -0.77 to -0.43, p<0.0001) for 1.8 mg and -0.34% (-0.51 to -0.16, p<0.0001) for 1.2 mg liraglutide. Nausea was more common with liraglutide (59 [27%] patients on 1.8 mg; 46 [21%] on 1.2 mg) than with sitagliptin (10 [5%]). Minor hypoglycaemia was recorded in about 5% of participants in each treatment group. Interpretation Liraglutide was superior to sitagliptin for reduction of HbA(1c), and was well tolerated with minimum risk of hypoglycaemia. These findings support the use of liraglutide as an effective GLP-1 agent to add to metformin. Funding Novo Nordisk.";Endocrine, nutritional or metabolic diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train

We evaluated the efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin in treatment-naive patients with type 2 diabetes. Research design and methods This was a 24-week parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial. Patients with A1C 7.0-10% (n = 485) were randomly assigned to one of seven arms to receive once-daily placebo or 2.5, 5, or 10 mg dapagliflozin once daily in the morning (main cohort) or evening (exploratory cohort). Patients with A1C 10.1-12% (high-A1C exploratory cohort; n = 73) were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive blinded treatment with a morning dose of 5 or 10 mg/day dapagliflozin. The primary end point was change from baseline in A1C in the main cohort, statistically tested using an ANCOVA. Results In the main cohort, mean A1C changes from baseline at week 24 were -0.23% with placebo and -0.58, -0.77 (P = 0.0005 vs. placebo), and -0.89% (P < 0.0001 vs. placebo) with 2.5, 5, and 10 mg dapagliflozin, respectively. Signs, symptoms, and other reports suggestive of urinary tract infections and genital infection were more frequently noted in the dapagliflozin arms. There were no major episodes of hypoglycemia. Data from exploratory cohorts were consistent with these results. Conclusions Dapagliflozin lowered hyperglycemia in treatment-naive patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes.

121;20609968;Effect of dapagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes who have inadequate glycaemic control with metformin: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.;"Background Correction of hyperglycaemia and prevention of glucotoxicity are important objectives in the management of type 2 diabetes. Dapagliflozin, a selective sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor, reduces renal glucose reabsorption in an insulin-independent manner. We assessed the efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin in patients who have inadequate glycaemic control with metformin. Methods In this phase 3, multicentre, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial, 546 adults with type 2 diabetes who were receiving daily metformin (>/=1500 mg per day) and had inadequate glycaemic control were randomly assigned to receive one of three doses of dapagliflozin (2.5 mg, n=137; 5 mg, n=137; or 10 mg, n=135) or placebo (n=137) orally once daily. Randomisation was computer generated and stratified by site, implemented with a central, telephone-based interactive voice response system. Patients continued to receive their pre-study metformin dosing. The primary outcome was change from baseline in haemoglobin A(1c)(HbA(1c)) at 24 weeks. All randomised patients who received at least one dose of double-blind study medication and who had both a baseline and at least one post-baseline measurement (last observation carried forward) were included in the analysis. Data were analysed by use of ANCOVA models. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00528879. Findings 534 patients were included in analysis of the primary endpoint (dapagliflozin 2.5 mg, n=135; dapagliflozin 5 mg, n=133; dapagliflozin 10 mg, n=132; placebo, n=134). At week 24, mean HbA(1c) had decreased by -0.30% (95% CI -0.44 to -0.16) in the placebo group, compared with -0.67% (-0.81 to -0.53, p=0.0002) in the dapagliflozin 2.5 mg group, -0.70% (-0.85 to -0.56, p<0.0001) in the dapagliflozin 5 mg group, and -0.84% (-0.98 to -0.70, p<0.0001) in the dapagliflozin 10 mg group. Symptoms of hypoglycaemia occurred in similar proportions of patients in the dapagliflozin (2-4%) and placebo groups (3%). Signs, symptoms, and other reports suggestive of genital infections were more frequent in the dapagliflozin groups (2.5 mg, 11 patients [8%]; 5 mg, 18 [13%]; 10 mg, 12 [9%]) than in the placebo group (seven [5%]). 17 patients had serious adverse events (four in each of the dapagliflozin groups and five in the placebo group).

Methods This 24-week, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group study was carried out in 82 centres in 10 countries. Patients with HbA1c levels of 7.0-10.0% on metformin and a maximum of one additional antidiabetes medication, which was discontinued at screening, continued on metformin ≥1500 mg/day for 6 weeks, including a placebo run-in period of 2 weeks, before being randomized to linagliptin 5 mg once daily (n = 524) or placebo (n = 177) add-on. The primary outcome was the change from baseline in HbA1c after 24 weeks of treatment, evaluated with an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Results Mean baseline HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) were 8.1% and 9.4 mmol/l, respectively. Linagliptin showed significant reductions vs. placebo in adjusted mean changes from baseline of HbA1c (-0.49 vs. 0.15%), FPG (-0.59 vs. 0.58 mmol/l) and 2hPPG (-2.7 vs. 1.0 mmol/l); all p < 0.0001.

123;21114607;Liraglutide provides similar glycaemic control as glimepiride (both in combination with metformin) and reduces body weight and systolic blood pressure in Asian population with type 2 diabetes from China, South Korea and India: a 16-week, randomized, double-blind, active control trial(*).;Aim To assess and compare the efficacy and safety of liraglutide with those of glimepiride, both in combination with metformin for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in Asian population from China, South Korea and India. Methods A 16-week, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, four-arm, active control trial was carried out. In total, 929 subjects with type 2 diabetes with a mean (±s.d.) age of 53.3 ± 9.5 years, HbA₁(c) of 8.6 ± 1.0% and body weight of 68.1 ± 11.7 kg were randomized (liraglutide 0.6, 1.2 or 1.8 mg once daily or glimepiride 4 mg once daily all in combination with metformin: 1 : 1 : 1 : 1). One subject withdrew immediately after randomization and before exposure. Results HbA₁(c) was significantly reduced in all groups compared with baseline. Treatment with liraglutide 1.2 and 1.8 mg was non-inferior to glimepiride (mean HbA₁(c) reduction: 1.36% points, 1.45% points and 1.39% points, respectively). No significant difference was shown in the percentage of subjects reaching American Diabetes Association HbA₁(c) target <7% or American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists target ≤6.5% between liraglutide 1.2 and 1.8 mg and glimepiride. Liraglutide was associated with a 1.8-2.4 kg mean weight reduction, compared with a 0.1 kg mean weight gain with glimepiride. Liraglutide led to a significantly greater reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP) compared with glimepiride. Two subjects in the glimepiride group reported major hypoglycaemia while none in the liraglutide groups. Liraglutide was associated with about 10-fold lower incidence of minor hypoglycaemia than glimepiride. Gastrointestinal disorders were the most common adverse events (AEs) for liraglutide, but were transient and resulted in few withdrawals. Conclusions In Asian subjects with type 2 diabetes, once-daily liraglutide led to improvement in glycaemic control similar to that with glimepiride but with less frequent major and minor hypoglycaemia. Liraglutide also induced a significant weight loss and reduced SBP and was generally well tolerated. The most frequently reported AE was transient nausea. The effect of liraglutide in this Asian population is comparable to the effects seen in Caucasian, African American and Hispanic populations in global liraglutide phase 3 trials.;Endocrine, nutritional or metabolic diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Test

We assessed the efficacy and safety of IDeg formulations administered once daily in combination with mealtime insulin aspart in people with type 1 diabetes. Research design and methods In this 16-week, randomized, open-label trial, participants (mean: 45.8 years old, A1C 8.4%, fasting plasma glucose [FPG] 9.9 mmol/L, BMI 26.9 kg/m(2)) received subcutaneous injections of IDeg(A) (600 μmol/L; n = 59), IDeg(B) (900 μmol/L; n = 60), or insulin glargine (IGlar; n = 59), all given once daily in the evening. Insulin aspart was administered at mealtimes. RESULTS At 16 weeks, mean A1C was comparable for IDeg(A) (7.8 ± 0.8%), IDeg(B) (8.0 ± 1.0%), and IGlar (7.6 ± 0.8%), as was FPG (8.3 ± 4.0, 8.3 ± 2.8, and 8.9 ± 3.5 mmol/L, respectively). Estimated mean rates of confirmed hypoglycemia were 28% lower for IDeg(A) compared with IGlar (rate ratio [RR]: 0.72 [95% CI 0.52-1.00]) and 10% lower for IDeg(B) compared with IGlar (RR: 0.90 [0.65-1.24]); rates of nocturnal hypoglycemia were 58% lower for IDeg(A) (RR: 0.42 [0.25-0.69]) and 29% lower for IDeg(B) (RR: 0.71 [0.44-1.16]). Mean total daily insulin dose was similar to baseline. The frequency and pattern of adverse events was similar between insulin treatments.

One hundred and eleven patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus and intolerant to metformin at the highest dosages (2500-3000 mg/day) were enrolled in this study. Patients were randomized to receive exenatide 5 μg twice a day or glimepiride 1mg three times a day and titrated after 1 month to exenatide 10 μg twice a day or glimepiride 2mg three times a day for 12 months in a randomized, single-blind, controlled study. We evaluated at the baseline and after 3, 6, 9, and 12 months these parameters: body weight, body mass index (BMI), HbA(1c), glycemic control, fasting plasma insulin, homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR) index, adiponectin, tumor necrosis factor-α, and high sensitivity-C reactive protein. Both treatments gave a similar improvement of glycemic control, without any differences between the two groups. Only exenatide gave a decrease of BMI, insulin resistance parameters such as fasting plasma insulin, HOMA-IR, and adiponectin and a decrease of inflammatory parameters such as tumor necrosis factor-α, and high sensitivity-C reactive protein. Furthermore, the values obtained with exenatide were significantly better than the values recorded with glimepiride. We can conclude that exenatide was better than glimepiride in improving insulin resistance and inflammatory state. Furthermore, adiponectin increase, and tumor necrosis factor-α reduction seem to be related to weight loss obtained with exenatide.;Endocrine, nutritional or metabolic diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train

Methods In this 24-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase III trial, 791 patients were randomized to one of six treatment arms. Two free combination therapy arms received linagliptin 2.5 mg twice daily (bid) + either low (500 mg) or high (1000 mg) dose metformin bid. Four monotherapy arms received linagliptin 5 mg once daily, metformin 500 mg or 1000 mg bid or placebo. Patients with haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) ≥11.0% were not eligible for randomization and received open-label linagliptin + high-dose metformin. Results The placebo-corrected mean (95% confidence interval) change in HbA1c from baseline (8.7%) to week 24 was -1.7% (-2.0, -1.4) for linagliptin + high-dose metformin, -1.3% (-1.6, -1.1) for linagliptin + low-dose metformin, -1.2% (-1.5, -0.9) for high-dose metformin, -0.8% (-1.0, -0.5) for low-dose metformin and -0.6 (-0.9, -0.3) for linagliptin (all p < 0.0001).

They were then randomized, along with patients previously receiving pioglitazone ≥30 mg, to 48 weeks of double-blind dapagliflozin 5 (n = 141) or 10 mg (n = 140) or placebo (n = 139) every day plus open-label pioglitazone. The primary objective compared HbA(1c) change from baseline with dapagliflozin plus pioglitazone versus placebo plus pioglitazone at week 24. Primary analysis was based on ANCOVA model using last observation carried forward; all remaining analyses used repeated-measures analysis. Results At week 24, the mean reduction from baseline in HbA(1c) was -0.42% for placebo versus -0.82 and -0.97% for dapagliflozin 5 and 10 mg groups, respectively (P = 0.0007 and P < 0.0001 versus placebo). Patients receiving pioglitazone alone had greater weight gain (3 kg) than those receiving dapagliflozin plus pioglitazone (0.7-1.4 kg) at week 48. Through 48 weeks: hypoglycemia was rare; more events suggestive of genital infection were reported with dapagliflozin (8.6-9.2%) than placebo (2.9%); events suggestive of urinary tract infection showed no clear drug effect (5.0-8.5% for dapagliflozin and 7.9% for placebo); dapagliflozin plus pioglitazone groups had less edema (2.1-4.3%) compared with placebo plus pioglitazone (6.5%); and congestive heart failure and fractures were rare.

We aimed to compare the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of insulin glargine and sitagliptin, a DPP-4 inhibitor, in patients whose disease was uncontrolled with metformin. Methods In this comparative, parallel, randomised, open-label trial, metformin-treated people aged 35-70 years with glycated haemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) of 7-11%, diagnosis of type 2 diabetes for at least 6 months, and body-mass index of 25-45 kg/m(2) were recruited from 17 countries. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to 24-week treatment with insulin glargine (titrated from an initial subcutaneous dose of 0·2 units per kg bodyweight to attain fasting plasma glucose of 4·0-5·5 mmol/L) or sitagliptin (oral dose of 100 mg daily). Randomisation (via a central interactive voice response system) was by random sequence generation and was stratified by centre. Patients and investigators were not masked to treatment assignment. The primary outcome was change in HbA(1c) from baseline to study end. Efficacy analysis included all randomly assigned participants who had received at least one dose of study drug and had at least one on-treatment assessment of any primary or secondary efficacy variable. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00751114. Findings 732 people were screened and 515 were randomly assigned to insulin glargine (n=250) or sitagliptin (n=265). At study end, adjusted mean reduction in HbA(1c) was greater for patients on insulin glargine (n=227; -1·72%, SE 0·06) than for those on sitagliptin (n=253; -1·13%, SE 0·06) with a mean difference of -0·59% (95% CI -0·77 to -0·42, p<0·0001). The estimated rate of all symptomatic hypoglycaemic episodes was greater with insulin glargine than with sitagliptin (4·21 [SE 0·54] vs 0·50 [SE 0·09] events per patient-year; p<0·0001). Severe hypoglycaemia occurred in only three (1%) patients on insulin glargine and one (<1%) on sitagliptin. 15 (6%) of patients on insulin glargine versus eight (3%) on sitagliptin had at least one serious treatment-emergent adverse event.

Options for treatment escalation remain controversial after failure of first-line treatment with metformin. We compared add-on exenatide with glimepiride for durability of glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled by metformin alone. Methods We did an open-label, randomised controlled trial at 128 centres in 14 countries between Sept 5, 2006, and March 29, 2011. Patients aged 18-85 years with type 2 diabetes inadequately treated by metformin were randomly assigned via a computer-generated randomisation sequence to receive exenatide twice daily or glimepiride once daily as add-on to metformin. Randomisation was stratified by predetermined categories of glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1C)) concentration. The primary outcome was time to inadequate glycaemic control and need for alternative treatment, defined as an HbA(1c) concentration of more than 9% after the first 3 months of treatment, or more than 7% at two consecutive visits after the first 6 months. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with EudraCT, number 2005-005448-21, and ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00359762. Findings We randomly assigned 515 patients to the exenatide group and 514 to the glimepiride group, of whom 490 versus 487 were the intention-to-treat population. 203 (41%) patients had treatment failure in the exenatide group compared with 262 (54%) in the glimepiride group (risk difference 12·4 [95% CI 6·2-18·6], hazard ratio 0·748 [0·623-0·899]; p=0·002). 218 (44%) of 490 patients in the exenatide group, and 150 (31%) of 487 in the glimepiride group achieved an HbA(1c) concentration of less than 7% (p<0·0001), and 140 (29%) versus 87 (18%) achieved concentrations of 6·5% and less (p=0·0001). We noted a significantly greater decrease in bodyweight in patients given exenatide than in those given glimepiride (p<0·0001). Five patients in each treatment group died from causes unrelated to treatment. Significantly fewer patients in the exenatide group than in the glimepiride group reported documented symptomatic (p<0·0001), nocturnal (p=0·007), and non-nocturnal (p<0·0001) hypoglycaemia. Discontinuation because of adverse events (mainly gastrointestinal) was significantly higher (p=0·0005) in the exenatide group than in the glimepiride group in the first 6 months of treatment, but not thereafter. Interpretation These findings provide evidence for the benefits of exenatide versus glimepiride for control of glycaemic deterioration in patients with type-2 diabetes inadequately controlled by metformin alone.

132;22776824;Dapagliflozin monotherapy in drug-naive patients with diabetes: a randomized-controlled trial of low-dose range.;"Aims Many patients with type 2 diabetes are suboptimally managed with currently available therapies. Dapagliflozin, a sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor, has shown efficacy in reducing diabetic hyperglycaemia. This study assessed efficacy of three lower doses in recently diagnosed patients. Methods This phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study assigned treatment-naive patients to placebo or dapagliflozin monotherapy (1, 2.5 or 5 mg) daily for 24 weeks. Patients were antidiabetic drug-naive with inadequate glycaemic control [haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) ≥7.0 and ≤10.0%]. The primary efficacy endpoint was change in HbA1c from baseline. Secondary endpoints included changes in body weight and fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and proportions achieving HbA1c <7%. Results A total of 282 patients with type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups. Baseline characteristics were similar across groups. At week 24, mean HbA1c reduction was significantly greater with dapagliflozin: -0.68% for 1 mg, -0.72% for 2.5 mg, -0.82% for 5 mg, versus 0.02% for placebo (p < 0.0001); compared to mean baseline values of 7.8-8.1%. Mean FPG reduction was significantly greater for all dapagliflozin groups versus placebo (p < 0.02), as was mean weight reduction (p < 0.003). During the treatment period, 19.1% of placebo-treated patients received rescue medication or discontinued because of poor glycaemic control versus 6.9, 4.1 and 5.9% for dapagliflozin 1, 2.5 and 5 mg, respectively. Percentages of patients experiencing ≥1 adverse event were similar across groups. Conclusion Dapagliflozin at doses of 1, 2.5 and 5 mg/day is effective in reducing glycaemic levels and body weight in treatment-naive patients with type 2 diabetes. Dapagliflozin was generally well tolerated. This insulin-independent mechanism suggests a new treatment for type 2 diabetes.";Endocrine, nutritional or metabolic diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train

The efficacy and safety of canagliflozin were evaluated in subjects with T2DM inadequately controlled with diet and exercise. Methods In this 26-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, subjects (N = 584) received canagliflozin 100 or 300 mg or placebo once daily. Primary endpoint was the change from baseline in haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) at week 26. Secondary endpoints included the proportion of subjects achieving HbA1c < 7.0%; change from baseline in fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2-h postprandial glucose (PPG) and systolic blood pressure (BP); and percent change in body weight, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglycerides. Adverse events (AEs) were recorded throughout the study. Results At week 26, HbA1c was significantly reduced from baseline with canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg compared with placebo (-0.77, -1.03 and 0.14%, respectively; p < 0.001 for both). Both canagliflozin doses significantly decreased FPG, 2-h PPG, body weight and systolic BP (p < 0.001 for all), and increased HDL-C compared with placebo (p < 0.01 for both). Overall incidences of AEs were modestly higher with canagliflozin versus placebo; rates of serious AEs and AE-related discontinuations were low and similar across groups. Incidences of genital mycotic infections, urinary tract infections and osmotic diuresis-related AEs were higher with canagliflozin; these led to few discontinuations. The incidence of hypoglycaemia was low across groups. Conclusion Canagliflozin treatment improved glycaemic control, reduced body weight and was generally well tolerated in subjects with T2DM inadequately controlled with diet and exercise.";Endocrine, nutritional or metabolic diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train

Methods In a multicenter, open-label trial, 130 patients whose diabetes had been inadequately controlled (HbA1c, 6.9-9.5%) with metformin and/or sulphonylurea were randomly assigned to a sitagliptin group (50 mg/day) or a pioglitazone group (15 mg/day) and were followed up for 24 weeks. At 16 weeks, if the patient's HbA1c level was ≥6.5%, the dose of sitagliptin or pioglitazone was increased up to 100 or 30 mg/day, respectively. Main outcome measure was the difference in the mean changes in the HbA1c level from baseline at 24 weeks between these two groups. Results Of the 130 patients who were enrolled, 115 subjects (sitagliptin group: 58 patients, pioglitazone group: 57 patients) completed this trial. At 0 weeks, the mean HbA1c level was 7.47 ± 0.66% in the sitagliptin group and 7.40 ± 0.61% in the pioglitazone group. At 24 weeks, the mean changes in the HbA1c level from baseline were -0.86 ± 0.63% versus -0.58 ± 0.68% (p = 0.024). Hypoglycaemia (2 patients, 3.4% vs. 2 patients, 3.5%), gastrointestinal symptoms (3 patients, 5.2% vs. 1 patient, 1.8%) and pretibial oedema (0 patients, 0% vs. 39 patients, 68.4%, p < 0.001) were observed for 24 weeks.

Methods A multicentre, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy study was conducted in 14 hospitals in Korea. Inclusion criteria were age 30-75 years, T2D diagnosis no longer than 10 years previously, A1C between 7% and 10%, and body mass index <40 kg/m(2) . A total of 207 subjects were randomised into the GM-SR group (n=101) or the GM group (n=106). Participants were assessed at baseline, 8 weeks and 16 weeks after treatment. Results After 16 weeks treatment, no difference in baseline-adjusted changes of A1C (primary efficacy variable) was observed between the two groups (-0.59% for GM-SR group vs. -0.61% for GM group, 95% CI: -0.17 to 0.21; p=0.84). In addition, there were no significant differences in secondary efficacy parameters between the two groups, including changes in A1C up to week 8, changes in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and 2-h-postprandial plasma glucose up to week 8 and week 16, response rate, drug compliance and hypoglycaemic events. However, there was a difference in baseline-adjusted changes of FPG between the two groups (-1.01 mmol/l for GM-SR group vs. -1.52 mmol/l for GM group, p=0.01 in the intention to treat set). Conclusions GM-SR 2/500 mg once daily was as effective as GM 1/250 mg twice daily in lowering A1C.

Methods Four hundred and eight patients (treatment-naive or after a 4-week wash-out period) were randomized to receive empagliflozin 5, 10 or 25 mg once daily, placebo or open-label metformin for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was change in haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) after 12 weeks. Results After 12 weeks' treatment, empagliflozin showed dose-dependent reductions in HbA1c from baseline [5 mg: -0.4%, 10 mg: -0.5%, 25 mg: -0.6%; all doses p < 0.0001 vs. placebo (+0.09%)]. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) decreased with empagliflozin [5 mg: -1.29 mmol/l, 10 mg: -1.61 mmol/l, 25 mg: -1.72 mmol/l; all doses p < 0.0001 vs. placebo (+0.04 mmol/l)]. Body weight decreased in all empagliflozin groups (all doses p < 0.001 vs. placebo). The incidence of adverse events (AEs) was similar in the placebo (32.9%) and empagliflozin (29.1%) groups. The most frequently reported AEs on empagliflozin were pollakiuria (3.3% vs. 0% for placebo), thirst (3.3% vs. 0% for placebo) and nasopharyngitis (2.0% vs. 1.2% for placebo). AEs consistent with urinary tract infections (UTIs) were reported in four (1.6%) patients on empagliflozin vs. one (1.2%) on placebo. Genital infections were reported in five (2%) patients on empagliflozin vs. 0% on placebo. No UTIs or genital infections led to premature discontinuation. Conclusions In patients with type 2 diabetes, empagliflozin resulted in dose-dependent, clinically meaningful reductions in HbA1c and FPG, and reductions in body weight compared with placebo.

137;23412078;Canagliflozin lowers postprandial glucose and insulin by delaying intestinal glucose absorption in addition to increasing urinary glucose excretion: results of a randomized, placebo-controlled study.;"Objective Canagliflozin, a sodium glucose cotransporter (SGLT) 2 inhibitor, is also a low-potency SGLT1 inhibitor. This study tested the hypothesis that intestinal canagliflozin levels postdose are sufficiently high to transiently inhibit intestinal SGLT1, thereby delaying intestinal glucose absorption. Research design and methods This two-period, crossover study evaluated effects of canagliflozin on intestinal glucose absorption in 20 healthy subjects using a dual-tracer method. Placebo or canagliflozin 300 mg was given 20 min before a 600-kcal mixed-meal tolerance test. Plasma glucose, (3)H-glucose, (14)C-glucose, and insulin were measured frequently for 6 h to calculate rates of appearance of oral glucose (RaO) in plasma, endogenous glucose production, and glucose disposal. Results Compared with placebo, canagliflozin treatment reduced postprandial plasma glucose and insulin excursions (incremental 0- to 2-h area under the curve [AUC0-2h] reductions of 35% and 43%, respectively; P < 0.001 for both), increased 0- to 6-h urinary glucose excretion (UGE0-6h, 18.2 ± 5.6 vs. <0.2 g; P < 0.001), and delayed RaO. Canagliflozin reduced AUC RaO by 31% over 0 to 1 h (geometric means, 264 vs. 381 mg/kg; P < 0.001) and by 20% over 0 to 2 h (576 vs. 723 mg/kg; P = 0.002). Over 2 to 6 h, canagliflozin increased RaO such that total AUC RaO over 0 to 6 h was <6% lower versus placebo (960 vs. 1,018 mg/kg; P = 0.003). A modest (∼10%) reduction in acetaminophen absorption was observed over the first 2 h, but this difference was not sufficient to explain the reduction in RaO. Total glucose disposal over 0 to 6 h was similar across groups. Conclusions Canagliflozin reduces postprandial plasma glucose and insulin by increasing UGE (via renal SGLT2 inhibition) and delaying RaO, likely due to intestinal SGLT1 inhibition.";Endocrine, nutritional or metabolic diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train

Research design and methods In this 52-week, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, phase 3 study, subjects using stable metformin plus sulfonylurea (N = 755) received canagliflozin 300 mg or sitagliptin 100 mg daily. Primary end point was change from baseline in A1C at 52 weeks. Secondary end points included change in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and systolic blood pressure (BP), and percent change in body weight, triglycerides, and HDL cholesterol. Safety was assessed based on adverse event (AE) reports. Results At 52 weeks, canagliflozin 300 mg demonstrated noninferiority and, in a subsequent assessment, showed superiority to sitagliptin 100 mg in reducing A1C (-1.03% [-11.3 mmol/mol] and -0.66% [-7.2 mmol/mol], respectively; least squares mean difference between groups, -0.37% [95% CI, -0.50 to -0.25] or -4.0 mmol/mol [-5.5 to -2.7]). Greater reductions in FPG, body weight, and systolic BP were observed with canagliflozin versus sitagliptin (P < 0.001).

Methods Insulin-naive subjects with type 2 diabetes [n = 458, age: 56 years, diabetes duration: 7.7 years, glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c): 8.9% (74 mmol/mol)] were randomized (1 : 1) to once-daily IDeg or Sita (100 mg orally) as add-on to stable treatment with 1 or 2 oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs). Results Superiority of IDeg to Sita in improving HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) was confirmed [estimated treatment difference (ETD) IDeg-Sita for HbA1c: -0.43%-points [95% confidence interval (CI): -0.61; -0.24, p < 0.0001] and for FPG: -2.17 mmol/l (95% CI: -2.59; -1.74, p < 0.0001)]. HbA1c < 7% (<53 mmol/mol) was achieved by 41% (IDeg) versus 28% (Sita) of patients, estimated odds ratio IDeg/Sita: 1.60 (95% CI: 1.04; 2.47, p = 0.034). There was no statistically significant difference in the rate of nocturnal confirmed hypoglycaemia between IDeg and Sita [0.52 vs. 0.30 episodes/patient-year, estimated rate ratio (ERR): IDeg/Sita: 1.93 (95% CI: 0.90; 4.10, p = 0.09)].

Subjects and design A randomized, placebo-controlled trial with a follow-up period of 4.3 years set in the outpatient clinics of three nonacademic hospitals (Hoogeveen, Meppel and Coevorden Hospitals, the Netherlands). A total of 390 patients with type 2 diabetes treated with insulin were included. Either metformin 850 mg or placebo (one to three times daily) was added to insulin therapy. Urinary albumin excretion and plasma levels of von Willebrand factor (vWf), soluble vascular adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), soluble E-selectin (sE-selectin), tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), C-reactive protein (CRP) and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) were measured at baseline and after 4, 17, 30, 43 and 52 months.

Methods We randomly assigned 16,492 patients with type 2 diabetes who had a history of, or were at risk for, cardiovascular events to receive saxagliptin or placebo and followed them for a median of 2.1 years. Physicians were permitted to adjust other medications, including antihyperglycemic agents. The primary end point was a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or ischemic stroke. Results A primary end-point event occurred in 613 patients in the saxagliptin group and in 609 patients in the placebo group (7.3% and 7.2%, respectively, according to 2-year Kaplan-Meier estimates; hazard ratio with saxagliptin, 1.00; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.89 to 1.12; P=0.99 for superiority; P<0.001 for noninferiority); the results were similar in the ""on-treatment"" analysis (hazard ratio, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.91 to 1.17). The major secondary end point of a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina, coronary revascularization, or heart failure occurred in 1059 patients in the saxagliptin group and in 1034 patients in the placebo group (12.8% and 12.4%, respectively, according to 2-year Kaplan-Meier estimates; hazard ratio, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.94 to 1.11; P=0.66). More patients in the saxagliptin group than in the placebo group were hospitalized for heart failure (3.5% vs. 2.8%; hazard ratio, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.07 to 1.51; P=0.007). Rates of adjudicated cases of acute and chronic pancreatitis were similar in the two groups (acute pancreatitis, 0.3% in the saxagliptin group and 0.2% in the placebo group; chronic pancreatitis, <0.1% and 0.1% in the two groups, respectively). Conclusions DPP-4 inhibition with saxagliptin did not increase or decrease the rate of ischemic events, though the rate of hospitalization for heart failure was increased.

Methods This randomised, double-blind, four-arm, parallel-group, Phase 3 study was conducted at 169 centres in 22 countries between April 2010 and August 2012. Participants (N = 1,284) with type 2 diabetes aged ≥ 18 and ≤ 80 years who had inadequate glycaemic control (HbA1c ≥ 7.0% [53 mmol/mol] and ≤10.5% [91 mmol/mol]) on metformin therapy received canagliflozin 100 mg or 300 mg, sitagliptin 100 mg, or placebo (n = 368, 367, 366, 183, respectively) for a 26 week, placebo- and active-controlled period followed by a 26 week, active-controlled period (placebo group switched to sitagliptin [placebo/sitagliptin]) and were included in the modified intent-to-treat analysis set. Randomisation was performed using a computer-generated schedule; participants, study centres and the sponsor were blinded to group assignment. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in HbA1c at week 26; secondary endpoints included changes in HbA1c (week 52) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG), body weight, and systolic blood pressure (BP; weeks 26 and 52). Adverse events (AEs) were recorded throughout the study. Results At week 26, canagliflozin 100 mg and 300 mg reduced HbA1c vs placebo (-0.79%, -0.94%, -0.17%, respectively; p < 0.001). At week 52, canagliflozin 100 mg and 300 mg demonstrated non-inferiority, and canagliflozin 300 mg demonstrated statistical superiority, to sitagliptin in lowering HbA1c (-0.73%, -0.88%,-0.73%, respectively); differences (95% CI) vs sitagliptin were 0% (-0.12, 0.12) and -0.15% (-0.27, -0.03), respectively. Canagliflozin 100 mg and 300 mg reduced body weight vs placebo (week 26: -3.7%, -4.2%, -1.2%, respectively; p < 0.001) and sitagliptin (week 52: -3.8%, -4.2%, -1.3%, respectively; p < 0.001). Both canagliflozin doses reduced FPG and systolic BP vs placebo (week 26) and sitagliptin (week 52) (p < 0.001). Overall AE and AE-related discontinuation rates were generally similar across groups, but higher with canagliflozin 100 mg. Genital mycotic infection and osmotic diuresis-related AE rates were higher with canagliflozin; few led to discontinuations. Hypoglycaemia incidence was higher with canagliflozin.

Results At week 24, HbA1c changed from a baseline of 8.3% (67 mmol/mol) by -0.6% (-6.6 mmol/mol) and by 0.1% (1.1 mmol/mol) with linagliptin and placebo, respectively (treatment difference -0.65% [95% CI -0.74 to -0.55] [-7.1 mmol/mol]; P < 0.0001). Despite the option to uptitrate basal insulin, it was adjusted only slightly upward (week 52, linagliptin 2.6 IU/day, placebo 4.2 IU/day; P < 0.003), resulting in no further HbA1c improvements. Frequencies of hypoglycemia (week 24, linagliptin 22.0%, placebo 23.2%; treatment end, linagliptin 31.4%, placebo 32.9%) and adverse events (linagliptin 78.4%, placebo 81.4%) were similar between groups. Mean body weight remained unchanged (week 52, linagliptin -0.30 kg, placebo -0.04 kg). Conclusions Linagliptin added to basal insulin therapy significantly improved glycemic control relative to placebo without increasing hypoglycemia or body weight.";Endocrine, nutritional or metabolic diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train
145;24118688;Efficacy and safety of canagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus inadequately controlled with metformin and sulphonylurea: a randomised trial.;"Aims Canagliflozin is a sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor developed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 study evaluated the efficacy and safety of canagliflozin as an add-on to metformin plus sulphonylurea in patients with T2DM. Methods Patients (N = 469) received canagliflozin 100 or 300 mg or placebo once daily during a 26-week core period and a 26-week extension. Prespecified primary end-point was change in HbA1c at 26 weeks. Secondary end-points included change in HbA1c at week 52 as well as proportion of patients achieving HbA1c < 7.0%, change in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and systolic blood pressure, and per cent change in body weight, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides (weeks 26 and 52). Results HbA1c was significantly reduced with canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg vs. placebo at week 26 (-0.85%, -1.06%, and -0.13%; p < 0.001); these reductions were maintained at week 52 (-0.74%, -0.96%, and 0.01%). Both canagliflozin doses reduced FPG and body weight vs. placebo at week 26 (p < 0.001) and week 52. Overall adverse event (AE) rates were similar across groups over 52 weeks, with higher rates of genital mycotic infections and osmotic diuresis-related AEs seen with canagliflozin vs. placebo; these led to few discontinuations. Increased incidence of documented, but not severe, hypoglycaemia episodes was seen with canagliflozin vs. placebo. Conclusions Canagliflozin improved glycaemic control, reduced body weight, and was generally well tolerated in T2DM patients on metformin plus sulphonylurea over 52 weeks.";Endocrine, nutritional or metabolic diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train

Research design and methods In this 24-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, phase 3 study with a 24-week blinded extension period, 432 patients were randomized to receive dapagliflozin 10 mg/day or placebo added to sitagliptin (100 mg/day) ± metformin (≥1,500 mg/day). Results Baseline HbA1c and FPG levels were 7.9% (63.0 mmol/mol) and 162.2 mg/dL (9.0 mmol/L) for the dapagliflozin group and 8.0% (64.0 mmol/mol) and 163 mg/dL (9.0 mmol/L) for placebo. At week 24, dapagliflozin significantly reduced mean HbA1c levels (-0.5% [-4.9 mmol/mol]) versus placebo (0.0% [+0.4 mmol/mol]). Dapagliflozin reduced body weight versus placebo (-2.1 and -0.3 kg) and reduced HbA1c levels in patients with baseline values ≥8.0% (-0.8% [8.7 mmol/mol] and 0.0% [0.3 mmol/mol]) and fasting plasma glucose levels (-24.1 mg/dL [-1.3 mmol/L] and 3.8 mg/dL [0.2 mmol/L]). Similar results were observed when data were stratified by background therapy. Glycemic and weight benefits observed at week 24 were maintained through week 48. Changes from baseline in systolic blood pressure at week 8 were not significantly different between treatment groups. Over 48 weeks, fewer patients receiving dapagliflozin were discontinued or rescued for failing to achieve glycemic targets compared with placebo. Adverse events were balanced between groups, and discontinuation rates were low. At week 48, signs and symptoms suggestive of genital infection were more frequent with dapagliflozin (9.8%) than with placebo (0.4%). Signs and symptoms suggestive of urinary tract infection were balanced between dapagliflozin (6.7%) and placebo (6.2%). Conclusions These results suggest that in patients with type 2 diabetes, inadequately controlled on sitagliptin with or without metformin, add-on treatment with dapagliflozin provides additional clinical benefit and is well tolerated.;Endocrine, nutritional or metabolic diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Test

Methods The 24-week randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study compared vildagliptin 50 mg, q.d., with placebo as add-on to glimepiride in T2DM patients who were inadequately controlled (HbA1c 7.5%-11.0% [58-97 mmol/mol]) on a stable dose of sulfonylurea for ≥12 weeks before study entry. Results In all, 279 patients were randomized to receive either vildagliptin (n = 143) or placebo (n = 136). At baseline, overall mean age was 58.5 years, body weight 68.1 kg, duration of diabetes 6.9 years and daily glimepiride dose 3.3 mg. After 24 weeks, the adjusted mean change (AMΔ) in HbA1c was -0.7% (-8 mmol/mol; baseline 8.6%, 70 mmol/mol) in the vildagliptin group and -0.2% (-2 mmol/mol; baseline 8.7%, 72 mmol/mol) in the placebo group, with a treatment difference of -0.5% (-5 mmol/mol; P < 0.001). The between-group difference in AMΔ in fasting plasma glucose was -0.4 mmol/L (P = 0.160). There was a slight, but not significant, decrease in body weight in both groups. No hypoglycemic events were reported in either group, including those patients reaching HbA1c <7.0%. Patients in the vildagliptin and placebo groups reported low and comparable incidences of adverse events (14.0% vs. 17.8%) and serious adverse events (0.7% in each group).

148;24920915;A double-blind, randomized trial, including frequent patient-physician contacts and Ramadan-focused advice, assessing vildagliptin and gliclazide in patients with type 2 diabetes fasting during Ramadan: the STEADFAST study.;"Background Several observational studies were conducted with vildagliptin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) fasting during Ramadan, showing significantly lower incidences of hypoglycemia with vildagliptin versus sulfonylureas, including gliclazide. It was of interest to complement the existing real-life evidence with data from a randomized, double-blind, clinical trial. Clinical trials identifier NCT01758380. Methods This multiregional, double-blind study randomized 557 patients with T2DM (mean glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c], 6.9%), previously treated with metformin and any sulfonylurea to receive either vildagliptin (50 mg twice daily) or gliclazide plus metformin. The study included four office visits (three pre-Ramadan) and multiple telephone contacts, as well as Ramadan-focused advice. Hypoglycemic events were assessed during Ramadan; HbA(1c) and weight were analyzed before and after Ramadan. Results The proportion of patients reporting confirmed (<3.9 mmol/L and/or severe) hypoglycemic events during Ramadan was 3.0% with vildagliptin and 7.0% with gliclazide (P=0.039; one-sided test), and this was 6.0% and 8.7%, respectively, for any hypoglycemic events (P=0.173). The adjusted mean change pre- to post-Ramadan in HbA(1c) was 0.05%±0.04% with vildagliptin and -0.03%±0.04% with gliclazide, from baselines of 6.84% and 6.79%, respectively (P=0.165). In both groups, the adjusted mean decrease in weight was -1.1±0.2 kg (P=0.987). Overall safety was similar between the treatments. Conclusion In line with the results from previous observational studies, vildagliptin was shown in this interventional study to be an effective, safe, and well-tolerated treatment in patients with T2DM fasting during Ramadan, with a consistently low incidence of hypoglycemia across studies, accompanied by good glycemic and weight control. In contrast, gliclazide showed a lower incidence of hypoglycemia in the present interventional than the previous observational studies. This is suggested to be linked to the specific circumstances of this study, including frequent patient-physician contacts, Ramadan-focused advice, a recent switch in treatment, and very well-controlled patients, which is different from what is often seen in real life.";Endocrine, nutritional or metabolic diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train
149;24921223;Assessment for ease of use and preference of a new prefilled insulin pen (FlexTouch Degludec U100/U200) versus the SoloSTAR insulin pen by patients with diabetes and healthcare professionals.;"Objective FlexTouch® (FT) is a new prefilled insulin pen with no push-button extension and a low injection force used to deliver several basal insulins, including insulin degludec across a wide dose range (1 - 80 units with FT 100 IU/ml [FT100] and 2 - 160 units with 200 IU/ml [FT200]). This study was carried out to evaluate whether the novel features of FT affect the preferences of the device among patients with diabetes and healthcare professionals compared with the widely used SoloSTAR® pen. Research design and methods A multicenter, randomized, open-label, crossover study compared FT100 and FT200 with SoloSTAR. The study included patients with either type 1 (n = 22) or type 2 diabetes (n = 42), nurses (n = 32) and physicians (n = 32). Subjects were randomized to test each of the FT100, FT200 and SoloSTAR pens in a crossover set up. Subjects performed injections into a foam cushion at 4 - 6 different doses per device (2, 20, 40, 80, 120 and 160 IU). Results Overall, a significantly higher proportion of subjects, including dexterity-impaired and pen-naive patients, preferred to use FT100 (93.0%; 119/128) and FT200 (91.4%; 117/128) compared with 2.3% (3/128) and 3.9% (5/128) who preferred SoloSTAR (p < 0.001), respectively. Conclusion FT100 and FT200 were preferred over SoloSTAR by nurses, physicians and patients with diabetes. This may be due to the novel design of FT, which improves ease of use, preference and confidence in delivering a complete, accurate dose of insulin, even at high doses.";Endocrine, nutritional or metabolic diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train

151;24948511;Comparison of empagliflozin and glimepiride as add-on to metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes: a 104-week randomised, active-controlled, double-blind, phase 3 trial.;"Background Metformin is the recommended first-line pharmacotherapy for patients with type 2 diabetes. There is no consensus on the optimum second-line pharmacotherapy. We compared the efficacy and safety of the sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor empagliflozin and the sulfonylurea glimepiride as add-on to metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes. Methods In this double-blind phase 3 trial, patients (aged ≥18 years) with type 2 diabetes and HbA1c concentrations of 7-10%, despite metformin treatment and diet and exercise counselling, were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio with a computer-generated random sequence, stratified by HbA1c, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and region, to empagliflozin (25 mg once daily, orally) or glimepiride (1-4 mg once daily, orally) as add-on to metformin for 104 weeks. Patients and investigators were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in HbA1c levels at weeks 52 and 104. Differences in the primary endpoint were first tested for non-inferiority (based on a margin of 0·3%). If non-inferiority was shown, differences in the primary endpoint at week 104 were then tested for superiority. Analysis was done on the full-analysis set-ie, patients who were treated with at least one dose of study drug and had a baseline HbA1c value. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01167881. A 104-week extension is ongoing. Findings Between August, 2010, and June, 2011, 1549 patients were randomly assigned to receive empagliflozin (n=769) or glimepiride (n=780); four patients in the empagliflozin group did not receive the assigned treatment. Empagliflozin was non-inferior to glimepiride at both timepoints. At week 104, adjusted mean difference in change from baseline in HbA1c with empagliflozin versus glimepiride was -0·11% (95% CI -0·19 to -0·02; p=0·0153 for superiority). Adverse events were reported in 661 (86%) patients treated with empagliflozin and 673 (86%) patients treated with glimepiride. Severe adverse events were reported in 72 (9%) patients in the empagliflozin group and 68 (9%) in the glimepiride group. Serious adverse events were reported in 119 (16%) patients in the empagliflozin group and 89 (11%) in the glimepiride group. Confirmed hypoglycaemic adverse events (plasma glucose ≤3·9 mmol/L or requiring assistance) at week 104 were reported in 19 (2%) patients treated with empagliflozin and 189 (24%) patients treated with glimepiride. Interpretation Empagliflozin might be an effective and a well tolerated second-line treatment option for patients with type 2 diabetes who have not achieved good glycaemic control on metformin.

The present Phase III randomized placebo-controlled double-blind, 24-week study evaluated the efficacy and safety of the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor linagliptin added to metformin in Asian T2DM patients. Methods In all, 306 patients (n = 265 Chinese; n = 24 Malaysian; n = 17 Filipino), aged 18-80 years with HbA1c between ≥7.0 and ≤10.0% and on metformin therapy were randomized (2:1) to either linagliptin 5 mg daily or placebo added to metformin. Antidiabetes drugs other than metformin were washed out prior to randomization. The primary endpoint was change in mean HbA1c from baseline after 24 weeks. Results Baseline characteristics were well-matched between the groups (overall mean [±SD] HbA1c 8.0 ± 0.8%). Adjusted mean (±SE) HbA1c decreased in the linagliptin and placebo groups by -0.66 ± 0.05 and -0.14 ± 0.07%, respectively (placebo-corrected difference -0.52 ± 0.09%; 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.70, -0.34; P < 0.0001).

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Avandamet or uptitrated metformin treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin alone. Methods This study was a 48-week, multicenter, randomized, open-labeled, active-controlled trial. Patients with inadequate glycaemic control (glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c] 7.5-9.5%) receiving a stable dose of metformin (≥1500 mg) were recruited from 21 centers in China (from 19 November, 2009 to 15 March, 2011). The primary objective was to compare the proportion of patients who reached the target of HbA1c ≤7% between Avandamet and metformin treatment. Results At week 48, 83.33% of patients reached the target of HbA1c ≤7% in Avandamet treatment and 70.00% in uptitrated metformin treatment, with significantly difference between groups. The target of HbA1c ≤6.5% was reached in 66.03% of patients in Avandamet treatment and 46.88% in uptitrated metformin treatment. The target of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) ≤6.1 mmol/L was reached in 26.97% of patients in Avandamet treatment and 19.33% in uptitrated metformin treatment. The target of FPG ≤7.0 mmol/L was reached in 63.16% of patients in Avandamet treatment and 43.33% in uptitrated metformin treatment. Fasting insulin decreased 3.24 ± 0.98 μU/ml from baseline in Avandamet treatment and 0.72 ± 1.10 μU/ml in uptitrated metformin treatment. Overall adverse event (AE) rates and serious AE rates were similar between groups. Hypoglycaemia occurred rarely in both groups. Conclusions Compared with uptitrated metformin, Avandamet treatment provided significant improvements in key parameters of glycemic control and was generally well tolerated.

At 52 weeks, similar findings were observed between LY IGlar and IGlar for safety outcomes, including adverse events, allergic reactions, hypoglycaemia, weight change and insulin antibodies. Conclusions Both LY IGlar and IGlar, when used in combination with mealtime insulin lispro, provided effective and similar glucose control and similar safety profiles.;Endocrine, nutritional or metabolic diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train
158;26044206;Effects of insulin degludec and insulin glargine on day-to-day fasting plasma glucose variability in individuals with type 1 diabetes: a multicentre, randomised, crossover study.;"Aims/hypothesis We compared the effects of insulin degludec (IDeg; Des(B30)LysB29(γ-Glu Nε-hexadecandioyl) human insulin) and insulin glargine (IGlar; A21Gly,B31Arg,B32Arg human insulin) on the day-to-day variability of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels in individuals with type 1 diabetes treated with basal-bolus insulin injections. Methods The effects of basal-bolus insulin therapy for 4 weeks with either IDeg or IGlar as the basal insulin in adult C-peptide-negative outpatients with type 1 diabetes were investigated in an open-label, multicentre, randomised, crossover trial. Randomisation was conducted using a centralised allocation process. The primary endpoints were the SD and CV of FPG during the final week of each treatment period. Secondary endpoints included serum glycoalbumin level, daily dose of insulin, intraday glycaemic variability and frequency of severe hypoglycaemia. Results Thirty-six randomised participants (17 in the IDeg/IGlar and 19 in the IGlar/IDeg groups) were recruited, and data for 32 participants who completed the trial were analysed. The mean (7.74 ± 1.76 vs 8.56 ± 2.06 mmol/l; p = 0.04) and SD (2.60 ± 0.97 vs 3.19 ± 1.36 mmol/l; p = 0.03) of FPG were lower during IDeg treatment than during IGlar treatment, whereas the CV did not differ between the two treatments. The dose of IDeg was smaller than that of IGlar (11.0 ± 5.2 vs 11.8 ± 5.6 U/day; p < 0.01), but other secondary endpoints did not differ between the treatments. Conclusions/interpretation IDeg yielded a lower FPG level and smaller day-to-day variability of FPG at a lower daily dose compared with IGlar in participants with type 1 diabetes. IDeg serves as a good option for basal insulin in the treatment of type 1 diabetes. Trial registration University Hospital Medical Information Network 000009965.

159;26052984;Effect of Sitagliptin on Cardiovascular Outcomes in Type 2 Diabetes.;"Background Data are lacking on the long-term effect on cardiovascular events of adding sitagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor, to usual care in patients with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Methods In this randomized, double-blind study, we assigned 14,671 patients to add either sitagliptin or placebo to their existing therapy. Open-label use of antihyperglycemic therapy was encouraged as required, aimed at reaching individually appropriate glycemic targets in all patients. To determine whether sitagliptin was noninferior to placebo, we used a relative risk of 1.3 as the marginal upper boundary. The primary cardiovascular outcome was a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or hospitalization for unstable angina. Results During a median follow-up of 3.0 years, there was a small difference in glycated hemoglobin levels (least-squares mean difference for sitagliptin vs. placebo, -0.29 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.32 to -0.27). Overall, the primary outcome occurred in 839 patients in the sitagliptin group (11.4%; 4.06 per 100 person-years) and 851 patients in the placebo group (11.6%; 4.17 per 100 person-years). Sitagliptin was noninferior to placebo for the primary composite cardiovascular outcome (hazard ratio, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.88 to 1.09; P<0.001). Rates of hospitalization for heart failure did not differ between the two groups (hazard ratio, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.83 to 1.20; P=0.98). There were no significant between-group differences in rates of acute pancreatitis (P=0.07) or pancreatic cancer (P=0.32). Conclusions Among patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease, adding sitagliptin to usual care did not appear to increase the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events, hospitalization for heart failure, or other adverse events.

160;26132939;A Randomized, Controlled Trial of 3.0 mg of Liraglutide in Weight Management.;"Background Obesity is a chronic disease with serious health consequences, but weight loss is difficult to maintain through lifestyle intervention alone. Liraglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue, has been shown to have potential benefit for weight management at a once-daily dose of 3.0 mg, injected subcutaneously. Methods We conducted a 56-week, double-blind trial involving 3731 patients who did not have type 2 diabetes and who had a body-mass index (BMI; the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) of at least 30 or a BMI of at least 27 if they had treated or untreated dyslipidemia or hypertension. We randomly assigned patients in a 2:1 ratio to receive once-daily subcutaneous injections of liraglutide at a dose of 3.0 mg (2487 patients) or placebo (1244 patients); both groups received counseling on lifestyle modification. The coprimary end points were the change in body weight and the proportions of patients losing at least 5% and more than 10% of their initial body weight. Results At baseline, the mean (±SD) age of the patients was 45.1±12.0 years, the mean weight was 106.2±21.4 kg, and the mean BMI was 38.3±6.4; a total of 78.5% of the patients were women and 61.2% had prediabetes. At week 56, patients in the liraglutide group had lost a mean of 8.4±7.3 kg of body weight, and those in the placebo group had lost a mean of 2.8±6.5 kg (a difference of -5.6 kg; 95% confidence interval, -6.0 to -5.1; P<0.001, with last-observation-carried-forward imputation). A total of 63.2% of the patients in the liraglutide group as compared with 27.1% in the placebo group lost at least 5% of their body weight (P<0.001), and 33.1% and 10.6%, respectively, lost more than 10% of their body weight (P<0.001). The most frequently reported adverse events with liraglutide were mild or moderate nausea and diarrhea. Serious events occurred in 6.2% of the patients in the liraglutide group and in 5.0% of the patients in the placebo group. Conclusions In this study, 3.0 mg of liraglutide, as an adjunct to diet and exercise, was associated with reduced body weight and improved metabolic control.

161;26179619;Efficacy and safety of liraglutide versus placebo added to basal insulin analogues (with or without metformin) in patients with type 2 diabetes: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial.;"Aim To confirm the superiority, compared with placebo, of adding liraglutide to pre-existing basal insulin analogue ± metformin in adults with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes [glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) 7.0-10.0% (53-86 mmol/mol)]. Methods In this 26-week, double-blind, parallel-group study, conducted in clinics or hospitals, 451 subjects were randomized 1 : 1 to once-daily liraglutide 1.8 mg (dose escalated from 0.6 and 1.2 mg/day, respectively, for 1 week each; n = 226) or placebo (n = 225) added to their pre-existing basal insulin analogue (≥20 U/day) ± metformin (≥1500 mg/day). After randomization, insulin adjustments above the pre-study dose were not allowed. The primary endpoint was HbA1c change. Results After 26 weeks, HbA1c decreased more with liraglutide [-1.3% (-14.2 mmol/mol)] than with placebo [-0.1% (-1.2 mmol/mol); p < 0.0001]. More subjects on liraglutide reached HbA1c targets: <7.0% (59% vs 14%; p < 0.0001) and ≤6.5% (43% vs 4%; p < 0.0001) using slightly less insulin (35.8 IU vs 40.1 IU). Greater decreases from baseline (estimated treatment differences vs placebo; p < 0.0001) occurred in fasting plasma glucose (-1.3 mmol/l), seven-point glucose profiles (-1.6 mmol/l), body weight (-3.1 kg) and systolic blood pressure (-5.0 mmHg). Transient gastrointestinal adverse events (nausea: 22.2% vs 3.1%) and minor hypoglycaemia (18.2% vs 12.4%) were more frequent with liraglutide than placebo, and pulse increased (4.5 beats/min) compared with placebo. No severe hypoglycaemia or pancreatitis occurred.

Research design and methods Patients receiving treatment with stable metformin (stratum A) (screening HbA1c level 8.0-11.5% [64-102 mmol/mol]) or stable metformin and a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor (stratum B) (HbA1c 7.5-10.5% [58-91 mmol/mol]) for ≥8 weeks received open-label saxagliptin 5 mg/day and metformin for 16 weeks (stratum A) or 8 weeks (stratum B) (saxagliptin replaced any DPP-4 inhibitor). Patients with inadequate glycemic control (HbA1c 7-10.5% [53-91 mmol/mol]) were randomized to receive placebo or dapagliflozin 10 mg/day plus saxagliptin and metformin. The primary end point was the change in HbA1c from baseline to week 24. Secondary end points included fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level, 2-h postprandial glucose (PPG) level, body weight, and proportion of patients achieving an HbA1c level of <7% (53 mmol/mol). Results Treatment with dapagliflozin add-on to saxagliptin plus metformin resulted in a greater mean HbA1c reduction than placebo (-0.82 vs. -0.10% [-9 vs. -1.1 mmol/mol], P < 0.0001). Significantly greater reductions in FPG level, 2-h PPG level, and body weight were observed, and more patients achieved an HbA1c level of <7% (53 mmol/mol) with treatment with dapagliflozin versus placebo. Adverse events were similar across treatment groups, with a low overall risk of hypoglycemia (∼1%). Genital infections developed in more patients with dapagliflozin treatment (5%) than with placebo (0.6%).

163;26367281;A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial of Adjunctive Metformin Therapy in Overweight/Obese Youth with Type 1 Diabetes.;"Context Insulin resistance has been proposed as one of the causes of poor glycemic control in overweight/obese youth with type 1 diabetes (T1D). However, the role of adjunctive metformin, an insulin sensitizer, on glycemic control in these patients is unclear. Objective To compare the effect of metformin vs. placebo on hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), total daily dose (TDD) of insulin, and other parameters in overweight/obese youth with T1D. Hypothesis Adjunctive metformin therapy will improve glycemic control in overweight/obese youth with T1D. Design, setting, and participants A 9-mo randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial of metformin and placebo in 28 subjects (13m/15f) of ages 10-20years (y), with HbA1c >8% (64 mmol/mol), BMI >85%, and T1D > 12 months was conducted at a university outpatient facility. The metformin group consisted of 15 subjects (8 m/ 7f), of age 15.0 ± 2.5 y; while the control group was made up of 13 subjects (5m/ 8f), of age 14.5 ± 3.1y. All participants employed a self-directed treat-to-target insulin regimen based on a titration algorithm of (-2)-0-(+2) units to adjust their long-acting insulin dose every 3rd day from -3 mo through +9 mo to maintain fasting plasma glucose (FPG) between 90-120 mg/dL (5.0-6.7 mmol/L). Pubertal maturation was determined by Tanner stage. Results Over the course of the 9 months of observation, the between-treatment differences in HbA1c of 0.4% (9.85% [8.82 to 10.88] for placebo versus 9.46% [8.47 to 10.46] for metformin) was not significant (p = 0.903). There were non-significant reduction in fasting plasma glucose (189.4 mg/dL [133.2 to 245.6] for placebo versus 170.5 mg/dL [114.3 to 226.7] for metformin), (p = 0.927); total daily dose (TDD) of short-acting insulin per kg body weight/day(p = 0.936); and the TDD of long-acting insulin per kg body weight per day (1.15 units/kg/day [0.89 to 1.41] for placebo versus 0.90 units/kg/day [0.64 to 1.16] for metformin) (p = 0.221). There was no difference in the occurrence of hypoglycemia between the groups. Conclusions This 9-month RCT of adjunctive metformin therapy in overweight and obese youth with T1D resulted in a 0.4% lower HbA1c value in the metformin group compared to the placebo group.

164;26378978;Empagliflozin, Cardiovascular Outcomes, and Mortality in Type 2 Diabetes.;"Background The effects of empagliflozin, an inhibitor of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2, in addition to standard care, on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk are not known. Methods We randomly assigned patients to receive 10 mg or 25 mg of empagliflozin or placebo once daily. The primary composite outcome was death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke, as analyzed in the pooled empagliflozin group versus the placebo group. The key secondary composite outcome was the primary outcome plus hospitalization for unstable angina. Results A total of 7020 patients were treated (median observation time, 3.1 years). The primary outcome occurred in 490 of 4687 patients (10.5%) in the pooled empagliflozin group and in 282 of 2333 patients (12.1%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio in the empagliflozin group, 0.86; 95.02% confidence interval, 0.74 to 0.99; P=0.04 for superiority). There were no significant between-group differences in the rates of myocardial infarction or stroke, but in the empagliflozin group there were significantly lower rates of death from cardiovascular causes (3.7%, vs. 5.9% in the placebo group; 38% relative risk reduction), hospitalization for heart failure (2.7% and 4.1%, respectively; 35% relative risk reduction), and death from any cause (5.7% and 8.3%, respectively; 32% relative risk reduction). There was no significant between-group difference in the key secondary outcome (P=0.08 for superiority). Among patients receiving empagliflozin, there was an increased rate of genital infection but no increase in other adverse events. Conclusions Patients with type 2 diabetes at high risk for cardiovascular events who received empagliflozin, as compared with placebo, had a lower rate of the primary composite cardiovascular outcome and of death from any cause when the study drug was added to standard care.

165;26620248;Blood pressure and glycaemic effects of dapagliflozin versus placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes on combination antihypertensive therapy: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study.;"Background Hypertension is a common comorbidity in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and a major risk factor for microvascular and macrovascular disease. Although the blood pressure-lowering effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are already established, guidance is needed on how to use these drugs in patients already receiving antihypertensive therapy. We aimed to compare blood pressure and glycaemic effects of the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin with placebo in patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Methods In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study we enrolled patients from 311 centres in 16 countries across five continents. Patients had uncontrolled type 2 diabetes (HbA1c 7·0%-10·5%; 53-91 mmol/mol) and hypertension (systolic 140-165 mm Hg and diastolic 85-105 mm Hg at both enrolment and randomisation, and a mean 24 h blood pressure of ≥130/80 mm Hg by ambulatory monitoring within 1 week of randomisation) and were receiving oral antihyperglycaemic drugs, insulin, or both, plus a renin-angiotensin system blocker and an additional antihypertensive drug. Using an interactive voice-response system, we randomly assigned (1:1) patients to dapagliflozin 10 mg once a day or to placebo, with randomisation stratified by additional antihypertensive drug use and insulin use at baseline, in a block size of two. The co-primary endpoints were changes in seated systolic blood pressure and HbA1c measured in the full analysis set, which included all patients who received at least one dose of study drug and had both a baseline and at least one post-baseline measurement of efficacy. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01195662. Findings Between Oct 29, 2010, and Oct 4, 2012, we randomly assigned 225 patients to dapagliflozin and 224 to placebo. Seated systolic blood pressure was significantly reduced in the group assigned to dapagliflozin (adjusted mean change from baseline -11·90 mm Hg [95% CI -13·97 to -9·82]) compared with those assigned to placebo (-7·62 mm Hg [-9·72 to -5·51]; placebo-adjusted difference for dapagliflozin -4·28 mm Hg [-6·54 to -2·02]; p=0·0002). Reductions in HbA1c concentrations were also significantly greater in patients assigned to dapagliflozin (adjusted mean change from baseline -0·63% [95% CI -0·76 to -0·50]) than in those assigned to placebo (-0·02% [-0·15 to 0·12]; placebo-adjusted difference -0·61% [-0·76 to -0·46,]; p<0·0001). In a post-hoc analysis, we found difference in blood pressure versus placebo was greater in patients receiving a β blocker (-5·76 mm Hg [95% CI -10·28 to -1·23]) or a calcium-channel blocker (-5·13 mm Hg, [-9·47 to -0·79]) as their additional antihypertensive drug than in those receiving a thiazide diuretic (-2·38 mm Hg [-6·16 to 1·40]). Adverse events were similar in the dapagliflozin and placebo groups (98 [44%] patients vs 93 [42%], respectively, had at least one adverse event), with few adverse events related to renal function (1% vs <1%) or volume depletion (<1% vs 0%). Interpretation Dapagliflozin 10 mg significantly improved blood pressure and HbA1c and was tolerated similarly to placebo. Its blood pressure-lowering properties were particularly favourable in patients already receiving a β blocker or calcium-channel blocker. Dapagliflozin could benefit patients with type 2 diabetes who need a diuretic-like effect to optimise control of blood pressure, adding meaningful efficacy to antihypertensive drug regimens.

166;26630143;Lixisenatide in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes and Acute Coronary Syndrome.;"Background Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are higher among patients with type 2 diabetes, particularly those with concomitant cardiovascular diseases, than in most other populations. We assessed the effects of lixisenatide, a glucagon-like peptide 1-receptor agonist, on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes who had had a recent acute coronary event. Methods We randomly assigned patients with type 2 diabetes who had had a myocardial infarction or who had been hospitalized for unstable angina within the previous 180 days to receive lixisenatide or placebo in addition to locally determined standards of care. The trial was designed with adequate statistical power to assess whether lixisenatide was noninferior as well as superior to placebo, as defined by an upper boundary of the 95% confidence interval for the hazard ratio of less than 1.3 and 1.0, respectively, for the primary composite end point of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or hospitalization for unstable angina. Results The 6068 patients who underwent randomization were followed for a median of 25 months. A primary end-point event occurred in 406 patients (13.4%) in the lixisenatide group and in 399 (13.2%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.89 to 1.17), which showed the noninferiority of lixisenatide to placebo (P<0.001) but did not show superiority (P=0.81). There were no significant between-group differences in the rate of hospitalization for heart failure (hazard ratio in the lixisenatide group, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.75 to 1.23) or the rate of death (hazard ratio, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.78 to 1.13). Lixisenatide was not associated with a higher rate of serious adverse events or severe hypoglycemia, pancreatitis, pancreatic neoplasms, or allergic reactions than was placebo. Conclusions In patients with type 2 diabetes and a recent acute coronary syndrome, the addition of lixisenatide to usual care did not significantly alter the rate of major cardiovascular events or other serious adverse events.

Dulaglutide significantly decreased fasting serum glucose from baseline compared with placebo (between-group difference -1.86 mmol/l (95% CI -2.58, -1.14) or -33.54 mg/dl (95% CI -46.55, -20.53); p < 0.001. Weight was decreased significantly from baseline in the dulaglutide group (p < 0.001); the between-group difference was not significant. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events for dulaglutide 1.5 mg were gastrointestinal: nausea (10.5%), diarrhoea (8.4%) and eructation (5.9%). Total hypoglycaemia was higher with dulaglutide 1.5 mg vs placebo (2.37 and 0.07 events/participant/year, respectively; p = 0.025). No severe hypoglycaemia was reported.

Research design and methods Patients were randomized to lixisenatide once daily or insulin glulisine given once or thrice daily, added to glargine, with or without metformin, if HbA1c remained ≥7 to ≤9% (≥53 to ≤75 mmol/mol) after 12 weeks of glargine optimization with OADs other than metformin stopped at the start of optimization. Coprimary end points at 26 weeks were 1) noninferiority (95% CI upper bound <0.4% [<4.4 mmol/mol]) in HbA1c reduction with lixisenatide versus glulisine once daily, and either 2a) noninferiority in HbA1c reduction for lixisenatide versus glulisine thrice daily or 2b) superiority in body weight change for lixisenatide versus glulisine thrice daily. Fasting and postprandial plasma glucose, composite efficacy/safety end points, and adverse events were also assessed. Results Baseline characteristics were similar between arms (n = 298, diabetes and basal insulin duration of 12.2 and 3.2 years, respectively; BMI 32.2 kg/m(2)). HbA1c improved from 8.5% to 7.9% (69 to 63 mmol/mol) with glargine optimization and further to 7.2%, 7.2%, and 7.0% (55, 55, and 53 mmol/mol) with lixisenatide and glulisine once daily and thrice daily, respectively; all coprimary end points were met. Symptomatic hypoglycemia and body weight were lower in lixisenatide versus glulisine patients. More gastrointestinal events occurred with lixisenatide.

172;27229178;Efficacy and safety of sitagliptin/metformin fixed-dose combination compared with glimepiride in patients with type 2 diabetes: A multicenter randomized double-blind study.;"Background Early initiation of combination therapy using antihyperglycemic agents is recommended for treating type 2 diabetes (T2D). The present multicenter double-blind randomized parallel-group study examined the efficacy and safety of a sitagliptin and metformin fixed-dose combination (Sita/Met) compared with glimepiride in T2D patients as initial treatment. Methods Type 2 diabetes patients (aged ≥18 years) were randomized to Sita/Met or glimepiride for 30 weeks after a wash-off run-in period. The primary endpoint was change from baseline (CFB) in HbA1c. Secondary endpoints included the proportion of patients achieving target goal (HbA1c < 7.0 % [53 mmol/mol]) and CFB in fasting plasma glucose (FPG). Safety assessments comprised weight gain from baseline and the incidence of adverse events (AEs). Results In total, 292 patients were randomized to Sita/Met (n = 147) or glimepiride (n = 145). After 30 weeks, Sita/Met demonstrated superiority over glimepiride in reducing HbA1c (-1.49 % vs -0.71 %, respectively; between-group difference - 0.78 %; P < 0.001). A significantly higher proportion of patients achieved the target goal with Sita/Met (81.2 %) than with glimepiride (40.1 %; P < 0.001). Greater reduction in FPG occurred with Sita/Met than with glimepiride (least-squares mean difference - 23.5 mg/dL; P < 0.001). Both drugs were generally well tolerated. Hypoglycemia events and weight gain were significantly lower in patients with Sita/Met than with glimepiride (5.5 % vs 20.1 % and -0.83 vs +0.90 kg, respectively; both P < 0.001). No serious drug-related AEs or deaths were reported.

173;27295427;Liraglutide and Cardiovascular Outcomes in Type 2 Diabetes.;"Background The cardiovascular effect of liraglutide, a glucagon-like peptide 1 analogue, when added to standard care in patients with type 2 diabetes, remains unknown. Methods In this double-blind trial, we randomly assigned patients with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular risk to receive liraglutide or placebo. The primary composite outcome in the time-to-event analysis was the first occurrence of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke. The primary hypothesis was that liraglutide would be noninferior to placebo with regard to the primary outcome, with a margin of 1.30 for the upper boundary of the 95% confidence interval of the hazard ratio. No adjustments for multiplicity were performed for the prespecified exploratory outcomes. Results A total of 9340 patients underwent randomization. The median follow-up was 3.8 years. The primary outcome occurred in significantly fewer patients in the liraglutide group (608 of 4668 patients [13.0%]) than in the placebo group (694 of 4672 [14.9%]) (hazard ratio, 0.87; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.78 to 0.97; P<0.001 for noninferiority; P=0.01 for superiority). Fewer patients died from cardiovascular causes in the liraglutide group (219 patients [4.7%]) than in the placebo group (278 [6.0%]) (hazard ratio, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.66 to 0.93; P=0.007). The rate of death from any cause was lower in the liraglutide group (381 patients [8.2%]) than in the placebo group (447 [9.6%]) (hazard ratio, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.74 to 0.97; P=0.02). The rates of nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and hospitalization for heart failure were nonsignificantly lower in the liraglutide group than in the placebo group. The most common adverse events leading to the discontinuation of liraglutide were gastrointestinal events. The incidence of pancreatitis was nonsignificantly lower in the liraglutide group than in the placebo group.

174;27299675;Empagliflozin and Progression of Kidney Disease in Type 2 Diabetes.;"Background Diabetes confers an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular and renal events. In the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial, empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, reduced the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes at high risk for cardiovascular events. We wanted to determine the long-term renal effects of empagliflozin, an analysis that was a prespecified component of the secondary microvascular outcome of that trial. Methods We randomly assigned patients with type 2 diabetes and an estimated glomerular filtration rate of at least 30 ml per minute per 1.73 m(2) of body-surface area to receive either empagliflozin (at a dose of 10 mg or 25 mg) or placebo once daily. Prespecified renal outcomes included incident or worsening nephropathy (progression to macroalbuminuria, doubling of the serum creatinine level, initiation of renal-replacement therapy, or death from renal disease) and incident albuminuria. Results Incident or worsening nephropathy occurred in 525 of 4124 patients (12.7%) in the empagliflozin group and in 388 of 2061 (18.8%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio in the empagliflozin group, 0.61; 95% confidence interval, 0.53 to 0.70; P<0.001). Doubling of the serum creatinine level occurred in 70 of 4645 patients (1.5%) in the empagliflozin group and in 60 of 2323 (2.6%) in the placebo group, a significant relative risk reduction of 44%. Renal-replacement therapy was initiated in 13 of 4687 patients (0.3%) in the empagliflozin group and in 14 of 2333 patients (0.6%) in the placebo group, representing a 55% lower relative risk in the empagliflozin group. There was no significant between-group difference in the rate of incident albuminuria. The adverse-event profile of empagliflozin in patients with impaired kidney function at baseline was similar to that reported in the overall trial population. Conclusions In patients with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk, empagliflozin was associated with slower progression of kidney disease and lower rates of clinically relevant renal events than was placebo when added to standard care.

175;27351380;The Effect of Sitagliptin on Carotid Artery Atherosclerosis in Type 2 Diabetes: The PROLOGUE Randomized Controlled Trial.;"Background Experimental studies have suggested that dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors provide cardiovascular protective effects. We performed a randomized study to evaluate the effects of sitagliptin added on to the conventional therapy compared with conventional therapy alone (diet, exercise, and/or drugs, except for incretin-related agents) on the intima-media thickness (IMT) of the carotid artery, a surrogate marker for the evaluation of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Methods and findings We used a multicenter PROBE (prospective, randomized, open label, blinded endpoint) design. Individuals aged ≥30 y with T2DM (6.2% ≤ HbA1c < 9.4%) were randomly allocated to receive either sitagliptin (25 to 100 mg/d) or conventional therapy. Carotid ultrasound was performed at participating medical centers, and all parameters were measured in a core laboratory. Of the 463 enrolled participants with T2DM, 442 were included in the primary analysis (sitagliptin group, 222; conventional therapy group, 220). Estimated mean (± standard error) common carotid artery IMT at 24 mo of follow-up in the sitagliptin and conventional therapy groups was 0.827 ± 0.007 mm and 0.837 ± 0.007 mm, respectively, with a mean difference of -0.009 mm (97.2% CI -0.028 to 0.011, p = 0.309). HbA1c level at 24 mo was significantly lower with sitagliptin than with conventional therapy (6.56% ± 0.05% versus 6.72% ± 0.05%, p = 0.008; group mean difference -0.159, 95% CI -0.278 to -0.041). Episodes of serious hypoglycemia were recorded only in the conventional therapy group, and the rate of other adverse events was not different between the two groups. As it was not a placebo-controlled trial and carotid IMT was measured as a surrogate marker of atherosclerosis, there were some limitations of interpretation. Conclusions In the PROLOGUE study, there was no evidence that treatment with sitagliptin had an additional effect on the progression of carotid IMT in participants with T2DM beyond that achieved with conventional treatment.

Materials and methods A randomized, multicentre, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled trial across 86 office- or hospital-based sites in North America, Europe and Asia. Subjects with type 2 diabetes who had inadequate glycaemic control (glycated haemoglobin [HbA1c] 7.5-9.5% on sitagliptin (100 mg/d) and metformin (≥1500 mg daily) for ≥90 days were randomized to either switch to liraglutide (n = 203) or continue sitagliptin (n = 204), both with metformin. The primary endpoint was change in HbA1c from baseline to week 26. Change in body weight was a confirmatory secondary endpoint. Results Greater reduction in mean HbA1c was achieved with liraglutide than with continued sitagliptin [-1.14% vs. -0.54%; estimated mean treatment difference (ETD): -0.61% (95% CI -0.82 to -0.40; p < 0.0001)], confirming superiority of switching to liraglutide. Body weight was reduced more with liraglutide [-3.31 kg vs. -1.64 kg; ETD: -1.67 kg (95% CI -2.34 to -0.99; p < 0.0001)]. Nausea was more common with liraglutide [44 subjects (21.8%)] than with continued sitagliptin [16 (7.8%)]. Three subjects (1.5%) taking sitagliptin reported a confirmed hypoglycaemic episode. Conclusions Subjects insufficiently controlled with sitagliptin who switch to liraglutide can obtain clinically relevant reductions in glycaemia and body weight, without compromising safety.

We assessed the effects of the GLP-1 receptor agonist liraglutide and the dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-4 inhibitor sitagliptin on hepatic steatosis and fibrosis in patients with type 2 diabetes. Methods In this 12 week, parallel, randomised, placebo-controlled trial, performed at the VU University Medical Center between July 2013 and August 2015, 52 overweight patients with type 2 diabetes treated with metformin and/or sulphonylurea agent ([mean ± SD] age 62.7 ± 6.9 years, HbA 7.3 ± 0.7% or 56 ± 1 mmol/mol) were allocated to once daily liraglutide 1.8 mg (n = 17), sitagliptin 100 mg (n = 18) or matching placebos (n = 17) by computer generated numbers. Both participants and researchers were blinded to group assignment. Hepatic fat content was measured using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-MRS). Hepatic fibrosis was estimated using three validated formulae. Results One patient dropped out in the sitagliptin group owing to dizziness, but no serious adverse events occurred. At week 12, no between-group differences in hepatic steatosis were found. Liraglutide reduced steatosis by 10% (20.9 ± 3.4% to 18.8 ± 3.3%), sitagliptin reduced steatosis by 12.1% (23.9 ± 3.0% to 21.0 ± 2.7%) and placebo lessened it by 9.5% (18.7 ± 2.7% to 16.9 ± 2.7%).

179;27633186;Semaglutide and Cardiovascular Outcomes in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes.;"Background Regulatory guidance specifies the need to establish cardiovascular safety of new diabetes therapies in patients with type 2 diabetes in order to rule out excess cardiovascular risk. The cardiovascular effects of semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide 1 analogue with an extended half-life of approximately 1 week, in type 2 diabetes are unknown. Methods We randomly assigned 3297 patients with type 2 diabetes who were on a standard-care regimen to receive once-weekly semaglutide (0.5 mg or 1.0 mg) or placebo for 104 weeks. The primary composite outcome was the first occurrence of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke. We hypothesized that semaglutide would be noninferior to placebo for the primary outcome. The noninferiority margin was 1.8 for the upper boundary of the 95% confidence interval of the hazard ratio. Results At baseline, 2735 of the patients (83.0%) had established cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, or both. The primary outcome occurred in 108 of 1648 patients (6.6%) in the semaglutide group and in 146 of 1649 patients (8.9%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.58 to 0.95; P<0.001 for noninferiority). Nonfatal myocardial infarction occurred in 2.9% of the patients receiving semaglutide and in 3.9% of those receiving placebo (hazard ratio, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.51 to 1.08; P=0.12); nonfatal stroke occurred in 1.6% and 2.7%, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.99; P=0.04). Rates of death from cardiovascular causes were similar in the two groups. Rates of new or worsening nephropathy were lower in the semaglutide group, but rates of retinopathy complications (vitreous hemorrhage, blindness, or conditions requiring treatment with an intravitreal agent or photocoagulation) were significantly higher (hazard ratio, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.11 to 2.78; P=0.02). Fewer serious adverse events occurred in the semaglutide group, although more patients discontinued treatment because of adverse events, mainly gastrointestinal.

Randomization was stratified based on metformin use (on or not on metformin) and type of insulin (pre-mixed vs intermediate-/long-acting) at screening. The primary end-point was the change from baseline at week 24 in HbA1c. Results The addition of sitagliptin led to a significantly (P < 0.001) greater week 24 HbA1c reduction (0.7%) compared with the reduction (0.3%) with placebo. A significantly (P = 0.013) greater proportion of patients taking sitagliptin (16%) had an HbA1c of <7.0% at week 24 compared with placebo (8%).

183;28385659;Efficacy and safety of once-weekly semaglutide versus once-daily sitagliptin as an add-on to metformin, thiazolidinediones, or both, in patients with type 2 diabetes (SUSTAIN 2): a 56-week, double-blind, phase 3a, randomised trial.;"Background Semaglutide is a novel glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue, suitable for once-weekly subcutaneous administration, in development for treatment of type 2 diabetes. We assessed the efficacy and safety of semaglutide versus the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor sitagliptin in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin, thiazolidinediones, or both. Methods We did a 56-week, phase 3a, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled, parallel-group, multinational, multicentre trial (SUSTAIN 2) at 128 sites in 18 countries. Eligible patients were aged at least 18 years (or at least 20 years in Japan) and diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, with insufficient glycaemic control (HbA 7·0-10·5% [53·0-91·0 mmol/mol]) despite stable treatment with metformin, thiazolidinediones, or both. We randomly assigned participants (2:2:1:1) using an interactive voice or web response system to 56 weeks of treatment with subcutaneous semaglutide 0·5 mg once weekly plus oral sitagliptin placebo once daily, subcutaneous semaglutide 1·0 mg once weekly plus oral sitagliptin placebo once daily, oral sitagliptin 100 mg once daily plus subcutaneous semaglutide placebo 0·5 mg once weekly, or oral sitagliptin 100 mg once daily plus subcutaneous semaglutide placebo 1·0 mg once weekly. The two oral sitagliptin 100 mg groups (with semaglutide placebo 0·5 mg and 1·0 mg) were pooled for the analyses. The primary endpoint was change in HbA from baseline to week 56, assessed in the modified intention-to-treat population (all randomly assigned participants who received at least one dose of study drug); change in bodyweight from baseline to week 56 was the confirmatory secondary endpoint. Safety endpoints included adverse events and hypoglycaemic episodes. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01930188. Findings Between Dec 2, 2013, and Aug 5, 2015, we randomly assigned 1231 participants; of the 1225 included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis, 409 received semaglutide 0·5 mg, 409 received semaglutide 1·0 mg, and 407 received sitagliptin 100 mg. Mean baseline HbA was 8·1% (SD 0·93); at week 56, HbA was reduced by 1·3% in the semaglutide 0·5 mg group, 1·6% in the semaglutide 1·0 mg group, and 0·5% with sitagliptin (estimated treatment difference vs sitagliptin -0·77% [95% CI -0·92 to -0·62] with semaglutide 0·5 mg and -1·06% [-1·21 to -0·91] with semaglutide 1·0 mg; p<0·0001 for non-inferiority and for superiority, for both semaglutide doses vs sitagliptin). Mean baseline bodyweight was 89·5 kg (SD 20·3); at week 56, bodyweight reduced by 4·3 kg with semaglutide 0·5 mg, 6·1 kg with semaglutide 1·0 mg, and 1·9 kg with sitagliptin (estimated treatment difference vs sitagliptin -2·35 kg [95% CI -3·06 to -1·63] with semaglutide 0·5 mg and -4·20 kg [-4·91 to -3·49] with semaglutide 1·0 mg; p<0·0001 for superiority, for both semaglutide doses vs sitagliptin). The proportion of patients who discontinued treatment because of adverse events was 33 (8%) for semaglutide 0·5 mg, 39 (10%) for semaglutide 1·0 mg, and 12 (3%) for sitagliptin. The most frequently reported adverse events in both semaglutide groups were gastrointestinal in nature: nausea was reported in 73 (18%) who received semaglutide 0·5 mg, 72 (18%) who received semaglutide 1·0 mg, and 30 (7%) who received placebo, and diarrhoea was reported in 54 (13%) who received semaglutide 0·5 mg, 53 (13%) who received semaglutide 1·0 mg, and 29 (7%) who received placebo. Seven (2%) patients in the semaglutide 0·5 mg group, two (<1%) in the semaglutide 1·0 mg group, and five (1%) in the sitagliptin group had blood-glucose confirmed hypoglycaemia. There were six fatal events (two in the semaglutide 0·5 mg group, one in the semaglutide 1·0 mg group, and three in the sitagliptin group); none were considered likely to be related to the trial drugs. Interpretation Once-weekly semaglutide was superior to sitagliptin at improving glycaemic control and reducing bodyweight in participants with type 2 diabetes on metformin, thiazolidinediones, or both, and had a similar safety profile to that of other GLP-1 receptor agonists. Semaglutide seems to be an effective add-on treatment option for this patient population. Funding Novo Nordisk A/S.";Endocrine, nutritional or metabolic diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train
184;28553078;Effects of metformin extended release compared to immediate release formula on glycemic control and glycemic variability in patients with type 2 diabetes.;"Purpose The purpose of this study is to evaluate, in a randomized clinical trial, the effects of metformin immediate release (IR) compared with metformin extended release (XR) on the gastrointestinal tolerability and glycemic control. Materials and methods We enrolled 253 Caucasian patients with type 2 diabetes not well controlled by diet (glycated hemoglobin [HbA] >7.0% and <8.5%). Patients were randomized to metformin IR or metformin XR for a period of 6 months at the maximum tolerated dose. The average dose of metformin IR used was 2,000±1,000 mg/day, while that of metformin XR was 1,000±500 mg/day. We evaluated body weight, HbA, fasting and postprandial glucose, fasting plasma insulin (FPI) and homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), lipid profile, and levels of some adipocytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), visfatin, and vaspin. Moreover, at the baseline and after 6 months, we administered patients some validated questionnaires to assess patients' satisfaction toward treatments. Results After 6 months, both formulations gave a similar reduction in body weight and body mass index (BMI); however, metformin XR gave a greater improvement in glycemic control, FPI, and HOMA-IR, compared with both baseline and metformin IR. A reduction in total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol was observed with metformin XR compared with IR. Levels of TNF-α, hs-CRP, and vaspin were reduced by metformin XR but not by the IR formulation. Metformin XR also raised the levels of visfatin. Conclusion Metformin XR formulation seems to be more effective than metformin IR in improving glyco-metabolic control, lipid profile, and levels of some adipocytokines in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.";Endocrine, nutritional or metabolic diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train
185;28605603;Efficacy and Safety of Degludec versus Glargine in Type 2 Diabetes.;"Background Degludec is an ultralong-acting, once-daily basal insulin that is approved for use in adults, adolescents, and children with diabetes. Previous open-label studies have shown lower day-to-day variability in the glucose-lowering effect and lower rates of hypoglycemia among patients who received degludec than among those who received basal insulin glargine. However, data are lacking on the cardiovascular safety of degludec. Methods We randomly assigned 7637 patients with type 2 diabetes to receive either insulin degludec (3818 patients) or insulin glargine U100 (3819 patients) once daily between dinner and bedtime in a double-blind, treat-to-target, event-driven cardiovascular outcomes trial. The primary composite outcome in the time-to-event analysis was the first occurrence of an adjudicated major cardiovascular event (death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke) with a prespecified noninferiority margin of 1.3. Adjudicated severe hypoglycemia, as defined by the American Diabetes Association, was the prespecified, multiplicity-adjusted secondary outcome. Results Of the patients who underwent randomization, 6509 (85.2%) had established cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, or both. At baseline, the mean age was 65.0 years, the mean duration of diabetes was 16.4 years, and the mean (±SD) glycated hemoglobin level was 8.4±1.7%; 83.9% of the patients were receiving insulin. The primary outcome occurred in 325 patients (8.5%) in the degludec group and in 356 (9.3%) in the glargine group (hazard ratio, 0.91; 95% confidence interval, 0.78 to 1.06; P<0.001 for noninferiority). At 24 months, the mean glycated hemoglobin level was 7.5±1.2% in each group, whereas the mean fasting plasma glucose level was significantly lower in the degludec group than in the glargine group (128±56 vs. 136±57 mg per deciliter, P<0.001). Prespecified adjudicated severe hypoglycemia occurred in 187 patients (4.9%) in the degludec group and in 252 (6.6%) in the glargine group, for an absolute difference of 1.7 percentage points (rate ratio, 0.60; P<0.001 for superiority; odds ratio, 0.73; P<0.001 for superiority). Rates of adverse events did not differ between the two groups. Conclusions Among patients with type 2 diabetes at high risk for cardiovascular events, degludec was noninferior to glargine with respect to the incidence of major cardiovascular events.

We have compared these insulins over 1 year in people with type 1 diabetes (T1DM). Methods EDITION 4 was a 6-month, multicentre, randomized, open-label phase 3 study. People with T1DM who completed the 6 months continued randomized Gla-300 or Gla-100 once daily, morning or evening, for a further 6 months. Results Among 549 participants randomized, 444 completed the 12-month study period (Gla-300, 80%; Gla-100, 82%). Mean HbA1c decreased similarly from baseline to month 12 in the 2 treatment groups (difference, 0.02 [95% CI, -0.13 to 0.17]) %-units [0.2 (-1.5 to 1.9) mmol/mol]), to a mean of 7.86 %-units (62.4 mmol/mol) in both groups. For morning vs evening injection, there was no difference in HbA1c change over 12 months for Gla-100, but a significantly larger decrease in HbA1c was observed in the Gla-300 morning group than in the Gla-300 evening group (difference, -0.25 [-0.47 to -0.04] %-units [-2.7 (-5.2 to -0.4) mmol/mol]). Mean glucose from the 8-point SMPG profiles decreased from baseline, and was similar between the 2 treatment groups. Basal insulin dose was 20% higher with Gla-300 than with Gla-100, while hypoglycaemia event rates, analysed at night, over 24 hours, or according to different glycaemic thresholds, did not differ between treatment groups, regardless of injection time. Adverse event profiles did not differ between groups. Conclusions In T1DM, Gla-300 provides glucose control comparable to that of Gla-100, and can be given at any time of day.";Endocrine, nutritional or metabolic diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train
187;28672316;Effect of Insulin Degludec vs Insulin Glargine U100 on Hypoglycemia in Patients With Type 1 Diabetes: The SWITCH 1 Randomized Clinical Trial.;"Importance Hypoglycemia, common in patients with type 1 diabetes, is a major barrier to achieving good glycemic control. Severe hypoglycemia can lead to coma or death. Objective To determine whether insulin degludec is noninferior or superior to insulin glargine U100 in reducing the rate of symptomatic hypoglycemic episodes. Design, setting, and participants Double-blind, randomized, crossover noninferiority trial involving 501 adults with at least 1 hypoglycemia risk factor treated at 84 US and 6 Polish centers (January 2014-January 12, 2016) for two 32-week treatment periods, each with a 16-week titration and a 16-week maintenance period. Interventions Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive once-daily insulin degludec followed by insulin glargine U100 (n = 249) or to receive insulin glargine U100 followed by insulin degludec (n = 252) and randomized 1:1 to morning or evening dosing within each treatment sequence. Main outcomes and measures The primary end point was the rate of overall severe or blood glucose-confirmed (<56 mg/dL) symptomatic hypoglycemic episodes during the maintenance period. Secondary end points included the rate of nocturnal symptomatic hypoglycemic episodes and proportion of patients with severe hypoglycemia during the maintenance period. The noninferiority criterion for the primary end point and for the secondary end point of nocturnal hypoglycemia was defined as an upper limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for a rate ratio of 1.10 or lower; if noninferiority was established, 2-sided statistical testing for superiority was conducted. Results Of the 501 patients randomized (mean age, 45.9 years; 53.7% men), 395 (78.8%) completed the trial. During the maintenance period, the rates of overall symptomatic hypoglycemia were 2200.9 episodes per 100 person-years' exposure (PYE) in the insulin degludec group vs 2462.7 episodes per 100 PYE in the insulin glargine U100 group for a rate ratio (RR) of 0.89 (95% CI, 0.85-0.94; P < .001 for noninferiority; P < .001 for superiority; rate difference, -130.31 episodes per 100 PYE; 95% CI, -193.5 to -67.16). The rates of nocturnal symptomatic hypoglycemia were 277.1 per 100 PYE in the insulin degludec group vs 428.6 episodes per 100 PYE in the insulin glargine U100 group, for an RR of 0.64 (95% CI, 0.56-0.73; P < .001 for noninferiority; P < .001 for superiority; rate difference, -61.94 episodes per 100 PYE; 95% CI, -83.85 to -40.03). A lower proportion of patients in the insulin degludec than in the insulin glargine U100 group experienced severe hypoglycemia during the maintenance period (10.3%, 95% CI, 7.3%-13.3% vs 17.1%, 95% CI, 13.4%-20.8%, respectively; McNemar P = .002; risk difference, -6.8%; 95% CI, -10.8% to -2.7%). Conclusions and relevance Among patients with type 1 diabetes and at least 1 risk factor for hypoglycemia, 32 weeks' treatment with insulin degludec vs insulin glargine U100 resulted in a reduced rate of overall symptomatic hypoglycemic episodes.

Objective To test whether treatment with basal insulin degludec is associated with a lower rate of hypoglycemia compared with insulin glargine U100 in patients with type 2 diabetes. Design, setting, and participants Randomized, double-blind, treat-to-target crossover trial including two 32-week treatment periods, each with a 16-week titration period and a 16-week maintenance period. The trial was conducted at 152 US centers between January 2014 and December 2015 in 721 adults with type 2 diabetes and at least 1 hypoglycemia risk factor who were previously treated with basal insulin with or without oral antidiabetic drugs. Interventions Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive once-daily insulin degludec followed by insulin glargine U100 (n = 361) or to receive insulin glargine U100 followed by insulin degludec (n = 360) and randomized 1:1 to morning or evening dosing within each treatment sequence. Main outcomes and measures The primary end point was the rate of overall symptomatic hypoglycemic episodes (severe or blood glucose confirmed [<56 mg/dL]) during the maintenance period. Secondary end points were the rate of nocturnal symptomatic hypoglycemic episodes (severe or blood glucose confirmed, occurring between 12:01 am and 5:59 am) and the proportion of patients with severe hypoglycemia during the maintenance period. Results Of the 721 patients randomized (mean [SD] age, 61.4 [10.5] years; 53.1% male), 580 (80.4%) completed the trial.

190;28899222;Effects of Sotagliflozin Added to Insulin in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes.;"Background In most patients with type 1 diabetes, adequate glycemic control is not achieved with insulin therapy alone. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of sotagliflozin, an oral inhibitor of sodium-glucose cotransporters 1 and 2, in combination with insulin treatment in patients with type 1 diabetes. Methods In this phase 3, double-blind trial, which was conducted at 133 centers worldwide, we randomly assigned 1402 patients with type 1 diabetes who were receiving treatment with any insulin therapy (pump or injections) to receive sotagliflozin (400 mg per day) or placebo for 24 weeks. The primary end point was a glycated hemoglobin level lower than 7.0% at week 24, with no episodes of severe hypoglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis after randomization. Secondary end points included the change from baseline in glycated hemoglobin level, weight, systolic blood pressure, and mean daily bolus dose of insulin. Results A significantly larger proportion of patients in the sotagliflozin group than in the placebo group achieved the primary end point (200 of 699 patients [28.6%] vs. 107 of 703 [15.2%], P<0.001). The least-squares mean change from baseline was significantly greater in the sotagliflozin group than in the placebo group for glycated hemoglobin (difference, -0.46 percentage points), weight (-2.98 kg), systolic blood pressure (-3.5 mm Hg), and mean daily bolus dose of insulin (-2.8 units per day) (P≤0.002 for all comparisons). The rate of severe hypoglycemia was similar in the sotagliflozin group and the placebo group (3.0% [21 patients] and 2.4% [17], respectively). The rate of documented hypoglycemia with a blood glucose level of 55 mg per deciliter (3.1 mmol per liter) or below was significantly lower in the sotagliflozin group than in the placebo group. The rate of diabetic ketoacidosis was higher in the sotagliflozin group than in the placebo group (3.0% [21 patients] and 0.6% [4], respectively). Conclusions Among patients with type 1 diabetes who were receiving insulin, the proportion of patients who achieved a glycated hemoglobin level lower than 7.0% with no severe hypoglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis was larger in the group that received sotagliflozin than in the placebo group.

191;28910237;Effects of Once-Weekly Exenatide on Cardiovascular Outcomes in Type 2 Diabetes.;"Background The cardiovascular effects of adding once-weekly treatment with exenatide to usual care in patients with type 2 diabetes are unknown. Methods We randomly assigned patients with type 2 diabetes, with or without previous cardiovascular disease, to receive subcutaneous injections of extended-release exenatide at a dose of 2 mg or matching placebo once weekly. The primary composite outcome was the first occurrence of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke. The coprimary hypotheses were that exenatide, administered once weekly, would be noninferior to placebo with respect to safety and superior to placebo with respect to efficacy. Results In all, 14,752 patients (of whom 10,782 [73.1%] had previous cardiovascular disease) were followed for a median of 3.2 years (interquartile range, 2.2 to 4.4). A primary composite outcome event occurred in 839 of 7356 patients (11.4%; 3.7 events per 100 person-years) in the exenatide group and in 905 of 7396 patients (12.2%; 4.0 events per 100 person-years) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.83 to 1.00), with the intention-to-treat analysis indicating that exenatide, administered once weekly, was noninferior to placebo with respect to safety (P<0.001 for noninferiority) but was not superior to placebo with respect to efficacy (P=0.06 for superiority). The rates of death from cardiovascular causes, fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction, fatal or nonfatal stroke, hospitalization for heart failure, and hospitalization for acute coronary syndrome, and the incidence of acute pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, medullary thyroid carcinoma, and serious adverse events did not differ significantly between the two groups.

192;28913543;DEVOTE 3: temporal relationships between severe hypoglycaemia, cardiovascular outcomes and mortality.;"Aims/hypothesis The double-blind Trial Comparing Cardiovascular Safety of Insulin Degludec vs Insulin Glargine in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes at High Risk of Cardiovascular Events (DEVOTE) assessed the cardiovascular safety of insulin degludec. The incidence and rates of adjudicated severe hypoglycaemia, and all-cause mortality were also determined. This paper reports a secondary analysis investigating associations of severe hypoglycaemia with cardiovascular outcomes and mortality. Methods In DEVOTE, patients with type 2 diabetes were randomised to receive either insulin degludec or insulin glargine U100 (100 units/ml) once daily (between dinner and bedtime) in an event-driven, double-blind, treat-to-target cardiovascular outcomes trial. The primary outcome was the first occurrence of an adjudicated major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE; cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke). Adjudicated severe hypoglycaemia was the pre-specified secondary outcome. In the present analysis, the associations of severe hypoglycaemia with both MACE and all-cause mortality was evaluated in the pooled trial population using time-to-event analyses, with severe hypoglycaemia as a time-dependent variable and randomised treatment as a fixed factor. An investigation with interaction terms indicated that the effect of severe hypoglycaemia on the risk of MACE and all-cause mortality were the same for both treatment arms, and so the temporal association for severe hypoglycaemia with subsequent MACE and all-cause mortality is reported for the pooled population. Results There was a non-significant difference in the risk of MACE for individuals who had vs those who had not experienced severe hypoglycaemia during the trial (HR 1.38, 95% CI 0.96, 1.96; p = 0.080) and therefore there was no temporal relationship between severe hypoglycaemia and MACE. There was a significantly higher risk of all-cause mortality for patients who had vs those who had not experienced severe hypoglycaemia during the trial (HR 2.51, 95% CI 1.79, 3.50; p < 0.001). There was a higher risk of all-cause mortality 15, 30, 60, 90, 180 and 365 days after experiencing severe hypoglycaemia compared with not experiencing severe hypoglycaemia in the same time interval. The association between severe hypoglycaemia and all-cause mortality was maintained after adjustment for the following baseline characteristics: age, sex, HbA, BMI, diabetes duration, insulin regimen, hepatic impairment, renal status and cardiovascular risk group. Conclusions/interpretation The results from these analyses demonstrate an association between severe hypoglycaemia and all-cause mortality. Furthermore, they indicate that patients who experienced severe hypoglycaemia were particularly at greater risk of death in the short term after the hypoglycaemic episode. These findings indicate that severe hypoglycaemia is associated with higher subsequent mortality; however, they cannot answer the question as to whether severe hypoglycaemia serves as a risk marker for adverse outcomes or whether there is a direct causal effect.

194;29199116;Repaglinide versus insulin for newly diagnosed diabetes in patients with cystic fibrosis: a multicentre, open-label, randomised trial.;"Background As survival among patients with cystic fibrosis has improved in recent decades, complications have become increasingly relevant. The most frequent complication is cystic-fibrosis-related diabetes. The recommended treatment is injected insulin, but some patients are treated with oral antidiabetic drugs to ease the treatment burden. We assessed the efficacy and safety of oral antidiabetic drugs. Methods We did a multicentre, open-label, comparative, randomised trial in 49 centres in Austria, France, Germany, and Italy. Eligible patients had cystic fibrosis, were older than 10 years, and had newly diagnosed diabetes. We used a central randomisation schedule derived from a Geigy random number table to assign patients 1:1 to receive insulin or repaglinide, stratified by sex and age (10-15 years or >15 years). The primary outcome was glycaemic control assessed by mean change in HbA concentration from baseline after 24 months of treatment. Differences between groups were assessed by linear models. The primary and safety analyses were done in the modified intention-to-treat population (including patients who stopped treatment early because of lack of efficacy). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00662714. Findings We enrolled 34 patients in the repaglinide group and 41 in the insulin group, of whom 30 and 37, respectively, were included in the analyses. At 24 months, glycaemic control was similar in the repaglinide and insulin groups (mean change in HbA concentration from baseline 0·2% [SD 0·7%], 1·7 mmol/mol [8·1 mmol/mol] with repaglinide vs -0·2% [1·3%], -2·7 mmol/mol, [14·5 mmol/mol] with insulin; mean difference between groups -0·4%, (95% CI -1·1 to 0·2 [-4·4 mmol/mol, -11·5 to 2·7], p=0·15). The most frequent adverse events were pulmonary events (43 [40%] of 107 in the repaglinide group and 60 [45%] of 133 in the insulin group), and the most frequent serious adverse events were pulmonary events leading to hospital admission (five [50%] of ten and seven [54%] of 13, respectively). Interpretation Repaglinide for glycaemic control in patients with cystic-fibrosis-related diabetes is as efficacious and safe as insulin.

This trial assesses the efficacy and safety of semaglutide, a GLP-1RA, as an add-on to basal insulin. Objective To demonstrate the superiority of semaglutide vs placebo on glycemic control as an add-on to basal insulin in patients with T2D. Design Phase 3a, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 30-week trial. Setting This study included 90 sites in five countries. Patients We studied 397 patients with uncontrolled T2D receiving stable therapy with basal insulin with or without metformin. Interventions Subcutaneous semaglutide 0.5 or 1.0 mg once weekly or volume-matched placebo. Main outcome measures Primary endpoint was change in glycated Hb (HbA1c) from baseline to week 30. Confirmatory secondary endpoint was change in body weight from baseline to week 30. Results At week 30, mean HbA1c reductions [mean baseline value, 8.4% (67.9 mmol/mol)] with semaglutide 0.5 and 1.0 mg were 1.4% (15.8 mmol/mol) and 1.8% (20.2 mmol/mol) vs 0.1% (1.0 mmol/mol) with placebo [estimated treatment difference (ETD) vs placebo, -1.35 (14.8 mmol/mol); 95% CI, -1.61 to -1.10 and ETD, -1.75% (19.2 mmol/mol); 95% CI, -2.01 to -1.50; both P < 0.0001]. Severe or blood glucose-confirmed hypoglycemic episodes were reported in 11 patients (17 events) and 14 patients (25 events) with semaglutide 0.5 and 1.0 mg, respectively, vs seven patients (13 events) with placebo (estimated rate ratio vs placebo, 2.08; 95% CI, 0.67 to 6.51 and estimated rate ratio vs placebo, 2.41; 95% CI, 0.84 to 6.96 for 0.5 and 1.0 mg; both P = nonsignificant). Mean body weight decreased with semaglutide 0.5 and 1.0 mg vs placebo from baseline to end of treatment: 3.7, 6.4, and 1.4 kg (ETD, -2.31; 95% CI, -3.33 to -1.29 and ETD, -5.06; 95% CI, -6.08 to -4.04 kg; both P < 0.0001). Premature treatment discontinuation due to adverse events was higher for semaglutide 0.5 and 1.0 mg vs placebo (4.5%, 6.1%, and 0.8%), mainly due to gastrointestinal disorders.

Materials and methods Participants using multiple daily injections of insulin for ≥12 months, with HbA1c of 7.5%-10.0%, entered a 2-week, open-label, placebo run-in period, followed by a 4-week, double-blind period during which participants were randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive empagliflozin 2.5 mg (n = 13), empagliflozin 10 mg (n = 12), empagliflozin 25 mg (n = 12) or placebo (n = 11). The primary objective was to assess the effect of empagliflozin vs placebo on urinary glucose excretion (UGE) after 7 days of treatment. Results PD: Empagliflozin resulted in a dose-dependent significant increase in 24-hour UGE compared with placebo (UGE placebo-corrected mean [95% confidence interval] change from baseline: 2.5 mg, 65.10 [43.29, 86.90] g/24 h; 10 mg, 81.19 [58.80, 103.58] g/24 h; 25 mg, 98.11 [75.91, 120.31] g/24 h). After 4 weeks of treatment, UGE increase was associated with improved glycaemic control, reduced body weight and decreased insulin needs. Empagliflozin treatment also resulted in dose-dependent increases in serum ketone bodies and free fatty acids. PK: Plasma empagliflozin levels increased in a dose-dependent manner and peaked at 1.5 hours. In this short study, empagliflozin was well tolerated, with no increase in rate of hypoglycaemia and no diabetic ketoacidosis events reported. Conclusions Based on this short-duration phase 2 study, the PK/PD profile of empagliflozin in Japanese participants with T1DM is comparable to that of non-Japanese participants.";Endocrine, nutritional or metabolic diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train

Methods This double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-centre, phase III study was conducted in Korea in 2015 to 2017. Patients were randomized to receive either ipragliflozin 50 mg/day or placebo once daily for 24 weeks in addition to metformin and sitagliptin. The primary endpoint was the change in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) from baseline to end of treatment (EOT). Results In total, 143 patients were randomized and 139 were included in efficacy analyses (ipragliflozin: 73, placebo: 66). Baseline mean (SD) HbA1c levels were 7.90 (0.69)% for ipragliflozin add-on and 7.92 (0.79)% for placebo. The corresponding mean (SD) changes from baseline to EOT were -0.79 (0.59)% and 0.03 (0.84)%, respectively, in favour of ipragliflozin (adjusted mean difference -0.83% [95% CI -1.07 to -0.59]; P < .0001). More ipragliflozin-treated patients than placebo-treated patients achieved HbA1c target levels of <7.0% (44.4% vs 12.1%) and < 6.5% (12.5% vs 1.5%) at EOT (P < .05 for both). Fasting plasma glucose, fasting serum insulin, body weight and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance decreased significantly at EOT, in favour of ipragliflozin (adjusted mean difference -1.64 mmol/L, -1.50 μU/mL, -1.72 kg, and -0.99, respectively; P < .05 for all). Adverse event rates were similar between groups (ipragliflozin: 51.4%; placebo: 50.0%). No previously unreported safety concerns were noted.

Research design and methods This 52-week, multicentre, double-blind, active-controlled study (NCT02471404) randomized (1:1:1) patients (n = 939; HbA1c 7.5%-10.5%) on metformin monotherapy (≥1500 mg/day) to add-on dapagliflozin 10 mg, dapagliflozin 10 mg plus saxagliptin 5 mg, or glimepiride 1 to 6 mg (titrated). The primary efficacy end point was change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 52. Results Baseline mean age, diabetes duration and HbA1c were 58.4 years, 7.0 years and 8.3%, respectively. Adjusted mean HbA1c change from baseline was -1.20% with dapagliflozin plus saxagliptin and -0.82% with dapagliflozin, vs -0.99% with glimepiride (mean dose at Week 52, 4.6 mg). Changes in body weight (-3.2 kg and -3.5 kg vs +1.8 kg) and systolic blood pressure (SBP; -6.4 mm Hg and -5.6 mm Hg vs -1.6 mm Hg) were significantly greater with dapagliflozin plus saxagliptin and dapagliflozin than with glimepiride. FPG decreased significantly with dapagliflozin plus saxagliptin compared with glimepiride (-2.1 mmol/L vs -1.5 mmol/L) and was similar with dapagliflozin (-1.6 mmol/L) compared with glimepiride. Confirmed incidence of hypoglycaemia was lower with dapagliflozin regimens than with glimepiride (0 and 1 vs 13 patients) and fewer patients required rescue. Genital infections were more frequent with dapagliflozin; other AE profiles were similar. Conclusions Dapagliflozin, saxagliptin and metformin improved glycaemic control compared with glimepiride plus metformin; add-on of dapagliflozin alone showed efficacy similar to that of glimepiride.

199;30291013;Albiglutide and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease (Harmony Outcomes): a double-blind, randomised placebo-controlled trial.;"Background Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists differ in chemical structure, duration of action, and in their effects on clinical outcomes. The cardiovascular effects of once-weekly albiglutide in type 2 diabetes are unknown. We aimed to determine the safety and efficacy of albiglutide in preventing cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke. Methods We did a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial in 610 sites across 28 countries. We randomly assigned patients aged 40 years and older with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease (at a 1:1 ratio) to groups that either received a subcutaneous injection of albiglutide (30-50 mg, based on glycaemic response and tolerability) or of a matched volume of placebo once a week, in addition to their standard care. Investigators used an interactive voice or web response system to obtain treatment assignment, and patients and all study investigators were masked to their treatment allocation. We hypothesised that albiglutide would be non-inferior to placebo for the primary outcome of the first occurrence of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke, which was assessed in the intention-to-treat population. If non-inferiority was confirmed by an upper limit of the 95% CI for a hazard ratio of less than 1·30, closed testing for superiority was prespecified. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02465515. Findings Patients were screened between July 1, 2015, and Nov 24, 2016. 10 793 patients were screened and 9463 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to groups: 4731 patients were assigned to receive albiglutide and 4732 patients to receive placebo. On Nov 8, 2017, it was determined that 611 primary endpoints and a median follow-up of at least 1·5 years had accrued, and participants returned for a final visit and discontinuation from study treatment; the last patient visit was on March 12, 2018. These 9463 patients, the intention-to-treat population, were evaluated for a median duration of 1·6 years and were assessed for the primary outcome. The primary composite outcome occurred in 338 (7%) of 4731 patients at an incidence rate of 4·6 events per 100 person-years in the albiglutide group and in 428 (9%) of 4732 patients at an incidence rate of 5·9 events per 100 person-years in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0·78, 95% CI 0·68-0·90), which indicated that albiglutide was superior to placebo (p<0·0001 for non-inferiority; p=0·0006 for superiority). The incidence of acute pancreatitis (ten patients in the albiglutide group and seven patients in the placebo group), pancreatic cancer (six patients in the albiglutide group and five patients in the placebo group), medullary thyroid carcinoma (zero patients in both groups), and other serious adverse events did not differ between the two groups. There were three (<1%) deaths in the placebo group that were assessed by investigators, who were masked to study drug assignment, to be treatment-related and two (<1%) deaths in the albiglutide group. Interpretation In patients with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, albiglutide was superior to placebo with respect to major adverse cardiovascular events. Evidence-based glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists should therefore be considered as part of a comprehensive strategy to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Despite adequate dosage, the incidence of complete and partial remission was low (10% vs 20%) and not superior to that usually obtained with single agent chemotherapy. By adding objective improvement, the over all response rate was 47% and 26%, respectively. The duration of complete plus partial remission was 7.5 and 7.2 months, the median survival for responders 19 and 8.3 months, respectively. After cross over, adriamycin plus bleomycin yielded response in 4/10 patients, cyclophosphamide plus vincristine objective improvement in 1/3 patients.

An add-on double-blind placebo-controlled crossover design was used, with 12 week treatment periods, and a 6 week washout period. Subjects were allocated to 1 of 2 dosing schedules according to their concomitant AEDs. Doses were increased according to clinical response. Although there was no significant reduction in total seizure count during the lamotrigine treatment period compared to placebo, there appears to be a drug effect as there was a marked reduction in generalized tonic-clonic seizures in favour of lamotrigine in the last 4 weeks of the treatment period. There was no significant difference in volunteered adverse experiences during active and placebo treatment.

Recombinant interferon-alpha (IFN) augments the cytotoxicity of both 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and cisplatin in vitro. A phase II study of 5-FU and IFN resulted in response rates of 25-27% in patients with metastatic esophageal carcinoma. Methods. A Phase II trial was initiated to determine the clinical utility of a three-drug combination (FIP) in patients with regionally advanced or metastatic esophageal carcinoma. Eligibility included biopsy-proven Stage III or IV squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma of the esophagus with no prior chemotherapy, adequate performance status, nutritional status, bone marrow, hepatic and renal function, and signed informed consent. Patients were treated in the exact sequence of IFN==>cisplatin==>5-FU. Patients received 5-FU, 750 mg/m2/day for 5 days followed by weekly bolus therapy at the same dose; cisplatin, 100 mg/m2 on Day 1, followed by weekly therapy, 25 mg/m2 over the course of 1 hour; and IFN, 10 MU subcutaneously 3 times/week beginning on Day 1. All patients received sargramostim (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, Escherichia coli-derived), 5 micrograms/kg subcutaneously 5 times/week. No patients received radiotherapy. Results. Twenty-four patients were enrolled; 23 were eligible, and 1 was excluded on pathology review (patient was found to have a leiomyoblastoma). The demographics of the population were: median age, 63 years (range, 43-73 years); 18 male patients; squamous cell carcinoma: adenocarcinoma ratio, 22:1, and Stage III:IV ratio, 10:13. Grade 3-4 National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria toxicities included: leukopenia (13), thrombocytopenia (14), and infection (9). Grade 3 diarrhea, mucositis, and vomiting occurred in 6 patients, 4 patients, and 1 patient, respectively. There were two instances of sudden death, likely related to tumor progression. Major responses occurred in 15 of 23 patients (65%; 95% confidence interval, 43%, 85%) (1 complete response, 14 partial responses). The median survival was 8.6 months; with a median follow-up of 26 months, estimated 30-month survival was 31%. Conclusions. This regimen, although moderately toxic, has substantial activity in metastatic and regionally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus.

203;9778618;Role of dose intensity in conservative treatment of anal canal carcinoma. Report of 35 cases.;"Chemoradiotherapy (CRT) is considered the standard treatment for anal canal cancer. However, the optimum schedule of therapy has yet to be defined. This study was carried out to evaluate the role of dose intensity (DI) of chemotherapy (ChT) and radiotherapy (RT) on the outcome of patients submitted to CRT. Thirty-five consecutive patients with anal canal carcinoma received a combination of RT (median dose 56 Gy) and ChT (two or more cycles of 5-fluorouracil and mitomycin C). With a median follow-up of 33 months, 83% of patients are alive without evidence of disease and 70% are colostomy-free. Five-year actuarial disease-free survival (DFS) is 74%. Univariate and multivariate analysis was performed to determine the correlation of DFS with various clinical and therapeutic parameters. Our series confirmed the prognostic negative value of a tumor size >4 cm. An average relative dose-intensity (ARDI) >0.8 was related to a better outcome both in univariate and in multivariate analysis; an overall treatment time >70 days was related to a worse DFS in univariate analysis, but these data were not confirmed by the Cox model. RT dose was not associated with DFS. In conclusion, the results of this study seem to suggest an independent prognostic role of ChT DI, as measured by ARDI. The results regarding RT DI are inconclusive, and remain a matter for further trials.";Neoplasms;Interventional;Indomain;Test
204;10091727;5-fluorouracil and levofolinic acid with or without recombinant interferon-2b in patients with advanced colorectal carcinoma: a randomized multicenter study with stratification for tumor burden and liver involvement by the Southern Italy Oncology Group.;"Background. The objectives of the current study were: 1) to verify whether the addition of modulating low doses of interferon-2b (IFN) to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and levofolinic acid (1-FA) could improve clinical results in patients with advanced colorectal carcinoma; and 2) to evaluate the role of tumor burden and liver involvement as prognostic factors. Methods. A total of 204 untreated patients were randomized to receive 1-FA at 100 mg/m2 and 5-FU at 375 mg/m2 for 5 consecutive days with or without IFN every 3 weeks. IFN was given subcutaneously at 3 MU/day for 7 days starting 2 days before chemotherapy administration. Patients were stratified according to the presence or absence of hepatic disease (H+ or H-) and to total tumor burden defined as ""low"" or ""high"" using an area of 10 cm2 as the cutoff value. Thus, four patient categories were obtained: Group 1: H+ > or = 10 cm2; Group 2: H+ < 10 cm2; Group 3: H- > or = 10 cm2; and Group 4: H- < 10 cm2. Results. No differences were observed in the objective response rate (23% for the combination of 1-FA and 5-FU vs. 24% for the 1-FA, 5-FU, and IFN regimen), median duration of response (11 months vs. 10 months), time to progression (5 months in both arms), and median survival (11 months vs. 12 months). A statistically significant improvement in response rate was observed in patients with limited liver involvement versus those with massive involvement independent of the chemotherapy arm (44% vs. 22%; P = 0.02). Overall survival also was improved in patients with limited liver disease (P = 0.0001) and in those without liver involvement (P = 0.004). Multivariate analysis confirmed these data and identified response and female gender as positive prognostic factors. Toxic side effects (mainly diarrhea, mucositis, and fever) were statistically more frequent in the IFN arm. Conclusions. The addition of low modulating doses of IFN to the regimen of 5-FU and I-FA failed to increase the response rate and survival of patients with advanced colorectal adenocarcinoma and significantly worsened toxicity. High tumor burden and the presence of liver involvement were confirmed prospectively as poor prognostic factors and should be taken in account in designing future Phase II or comparative trials.";Neoplasms;Interventional;Indomain;Train

To study how adding oxaliplatin (l-OHP) to chronomodulated fluorouracil (5-FU)-leucovorin (LV) affected the objective response rate, as first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. Patients and methods. Two hundred patients from 15 institutions in four countries were randomly assigned to receive a 5-day course of chronomodulated 5-FU and LV (700 and 300 mg/m(2)/d, respectively; peak delivery rate at 0400 hours) with or without l-OHP on the first day of each course (125 mg/m(2), as a 6-hour infusion). Each course was repeated every 21 days. Response was assessed by extramural review of computed tomography scans. Results. Grade 3 to 4 toxicity from 5-FU-LV occurred in </= 5% of the patients (</= 1% of the courses). Grade 3 to 4 diarrhea occurred in 43% of the patients given l-OHP (10% of the courses), and less than 2% of the patients had severe hematotoxicity. Thirteen percent of the patients had moderate functional impairment from peripheral sensory neuropathy. Sixteen percent of the patients receiving 5-FU-LV had an objective response (95% confidence interval [CI], 9% to 24%), compared with 53% of those receiving additional l-OHP (95% CI, 42% to 63%) (P <. 001).

Gemcitabine plus cisplatin (GC) and methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin (MVAC) were compared in patients with locally advanced or metastatic transitional-cell carcinoma (TCC) of the urothelium. Patients and methods. Patients with stage IV TCC and no prior systemic chemotherapy were randomized to GC (gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m2 days 1, 8 and 15; cisplatin 70 mg/m2 day 2) or standard MVAC every 28 days for a maximum of six cycles. Results. Four hundred five patients were randomized (GC, n = 203; MVAC, n = 202). The groups were well-balanced with respect to prognostic factors. Overall survival was similar on both arms (hazards ratio [HR], 1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.82 to 1.32; P = .75), as were time to progressive disease (HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.85 to 1.30), time to treatment failure (HR, 0.89; 95% CI 0.72 to 1.10), and response rate (GC, 49%; MVAC, 46%). More GC patients completed six cycles of therapy, with fewer dose adjustments. The toxic death rate was 1% on the GC arm and 3% on the MVAC arm. More GC than MVAC patients had grade 3/4 anemia (27% v 18%, respectively), and thrombocytopenia (57% v 21%, respectively). On both arms, the RBC transfusion rate was 13 of 100 cycles and grade 3/4 hemorrhage or hematuria was 2%; the platelet transfusion rate was four patients per 100 cycles and two patients per 100 cycles on GC and MVAC, respectively. More MVAC patients, compared with GC patients, had grade 3/4 neutropenia (82% v 71%, respectively), neutropenic fever (14% v 2%, respectively), neutropenic sepsis (12% v 1%, respectively), and grade 3/4 mucositis (22% v 1%, respectively) and alopecia (55% v 11%, respectively). Quality of life was maintained during treatment on both arms; however, more patients on GC fared better regarding weight, performance status, and fatigue. Conclusion. GC provides a similar survival advantage to MVAC with a better safety profile and tolerability. This better-risk benefit ratio should change the standard of care for patients with locally advanced and metastatic TCC from MVAC to GC.";Neoplasms;Interventional;Indomain;Train
207;12504662;Phase II study of carboplatin in patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma. A trial of the EORTC Gynaecological Cancer Group.;The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and toxicity of carboplatin given as monotherapy in endometrial adenocarcinoma. Cisplatin is one of the most active drugs in gynaecological cancer types, but at the cost of an associated high toxicity. In this high-risk population of endometrial cancer patients, it is necessary to have chemotherapy regimens with a low toxicity. Patients eligible for this study were those with histologically-confirmed endometrial adenocarcinoma with evidence of recurrent and/or metastatic disease. Carboplatin was administered every 4 weeks as a first- (dose: 400 mg/m(2)) or second- (dose: 300 mg/m(2)) line chemotherapy. Of the 64 patients who entered the trial, 60 were eligible, 53 patients were evaluable for toxicity and 47 for efficacy. A total of 169 cycles of carboplatin was given with a median of 2 cycles per patient (range 1-11 cycles) to a median cumulative dose of 798 mg/m(2) (range 290-3879 mg/m(2)). No grade 4 toxicity or toxic deaths occurred. White Blood Cell (WBC) toxicity grade 3 was noted five times, mainly in the radiotherapy pre-treated patients. Grade 3 non-haematological toxicity consisted mainly of nausea and vomiting (21%). There was a total of eight responses (3 Complete Responses (CR) and 5 Partial Responses (PR) with an overall response rate (ORR) of 13% (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 6-25). No responses occurred in patients treated with prior chemotherapy. In evaluable patients, the ORR in all patients (n=47) and in those receiving first-line chemotherapy (n=33) were, 17% (95% CI 8-31) and 24% (95% CI 11-42), respectively. After a median follow-up of 379 days, the median duration of response was 488 days (range 141-5303 days) with two very long responses in patients with a CR. Carboplatin has a low toxicity and is active in chemotherapy-naive advanced endometrial carcinoma patients. These results lead us to propose its use in association in first-line chemotherapy in recurrent or advanced endometrial carcinoma patients. The choice of the initial dose can be determined according to whether the patients have received prior radiotherapy treatment.;Neoplasms;Interventional;Indomain;Train
208;12881087;First-line chemotherapy with 5-FU and platinum for advanced and recurrent cancer of the cervix: a phase II study.;"This study was designed to assess the role of first-line chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and platinum in the treatment of advanced or recurrent cervical cancer. Ten patients with advanced or recurrent cancer of the cervix with no prior chemotherapy were entered in a phase II trial from October 2000 to November 2001. Eight patients were treated with Cis-platinum (50 mg/m2 over 60 minutes on the first day) followed by 5-FU (1 g/m2 over 24 hours for 4 days) and two patients with impaired renal function were treated with carboplatin (300 mg/m2 over 15 minutes on the first day) followed by 5-FU (1 g/m2 over 24 hours for 4 days) every 3 weeks until progression of disease or prohibitive toxicity had been observed. Median age was 52 years (range 28-70 years). Ten patients received a total of 42 cycles of chemotherapy. The mean number of chemotherapy cycles was 4.2 (median 4, range 3-7). Three patients had a partial response (30%, 95% CI, 1.7-58.5%). Mean duration of response was 198 days (range 122-273 days). Four patients required red blood cell transfusions; three of them had Grade II and one of the Grade III nausea and vomiting. Two had fever and neutropenia (one developed acute renal insufficiency), and there were no treatment related mortalities.

210;15175435;Bevacizumab plus irinotecan, fluorouracil, and leucovorin for metastatic colorectal cancer.;"Background. Bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor, has shown promising preclinical and clinical activity against metastatic colorectal cancer, particularly in combination with chemotherapy. Methods. Of 813 patients with previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer, we randomly assigned 402 to receive irinotecan, bolus fluorouracil, and leucovorin (IFL) plus bevacizumab (5 mg per kilogram of body weight every two weeks) and 411 to receive IFL plus placebo. The primary end point was overall survival. Secondary end points were progression-free survival, the response rate, the duration of the response, safety, and the quality of life. Results. The median duration of survival was 20.3 months in the group given IFL plus bevacizumab, as compared with 15.6 months in the group given IFL plus placebo, corresponding to a hazard ratio for death of 0.66 (P<0.001). The median duration of progression-free survival was 10.6 months in the group given IFL plus bevacizumab, as compared with 6.2 months in the group given IFL plus placebo (hazard ratio for disease progression, 0.54; P<0.001); the corresponding rates of response were 44.8 percent and 34.8 percent (P=0.004). The median duration of the response was 10.4 months in the group given IFL plus bevacizumab, as compared with 7.1 months in the group given IFL plus placebo (hazard ratio for progression, 0.62; P=0.001). Grade 3 hypertension was more common during treatment with IFL plus bevacizumab than with IFL plus placebo (11.0 percent vs. 2.3 percent) but was easily managed. Conclusions. The addition of bevacizumab to fluorouracil-based combination chemotherapy results in statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in survival among patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.";Neoplasms;Interventional;Indomain;Train
211;15657404;Rituximab therapy for patients with newly diagnosed, advanced-stage, follicular grade I non-Hodgkin's lymphoma: a phase II trial in the North Central Cancer Treatment Group.;"Purpose. Patients with newly diagnosed, advanced-stage, follicular grade 1 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) are often asymptomatic and can be observed without immediate chemotherapy. The goals of this study were to assess the overall response rate (ORR) to rituximab in this patient population and to determine the time-to-progression (TTP) and time-to-subsequent-chemotherapy (TTSC). Patients and methods. Eligible patients had untreated follicular grade 1 NHL, and measurable stage III/IV disease. Patients received rituximab 375 mg/m(2) intravenous weekly x 4 doses and were then followed for response and progression; no maintenance therapy was provided. Results. Thirty-seven patients were accrued; one patient was ineligible. The median age was 59 years (range, 29 to 83 years). Six patients (18%) had elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels. The ORR was 72%, with 36% complete remissions. Fourteen (39%) of 36 patients remain in unmaintained remission, two died without disease progression, and three died with disease progression. Twenty (56%) of 36 patients have disease progression. The median TTP was 2.2 years (95% CI, 1.3 to not yet reached). Eighteen patients have subsequently been treated with chemotherapy, with a median TTSC of 2.3 years (95% CI, 1.6 to not yet reached). Patients with a high lactate dehydrogenase level had a lower ORR of 33% and a short TTP of only 6 months. Conclusion. Rituximab can be safely administered to patients with advanced-stage follicular grade 1 NHL with efficacy and minimal toxicity. This therapy is highly active and offers an acceptable alternative to observation in this patient population. Patients with high LDH should not be considered for rituximab monotherapy.";Neoplasms;Interventional;Indomain;Train
212;16330675;Randomized phase III trial of whole-abdominal irradiation versus doxorubicin and cisplatin chemotherapy in advanced endometrial carcinoma: a Gynecologic Oncology Group Study.;"Purpose. To compare whole-abdominal irradiation (WAI) and doxorubicin-cisplatin (AP) chemotherapy in women with stage III or IV endometrial carcinoma having a maximum of 2 cm of postoperative residual disease. Patients and methods. Four hundred twenty-two patients were entered onto this trial. Of 396 assessable patients, 202 were randomly allocated to receive WAI, and 194 were allocated to receive AP. Irradiation dosage was 30 Gy in 20 fractions, with a 15-Gy boost. Chemotherapy consisted of doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 and cisplatin 50 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for seven cycles, followed by one cycle of cisplatin. Results. Most patient and tumor characteristics were well balanced. The median patient age was 63 years; 50% had endometrioid tumors. Median follow-up time was 74 months. The hazard ratio for progression adjusted for stage was 0.71 favoring AP (95% CI, 0.55 to 0.91; P < .01). At 60 months, 50% of patients receiving AP were predicted to be alive and disease free when adjusting for stage compared with 38% of patients receiving WAI. The stage-adjusted death hazard ratio was 0.68 (95% CI, 0.52 to 0.89; P < .01) favoring AP. Moreover, at 60 months and adjusting for stage, 55% of AP patients were predicted to be alive compared with 42% of WAI patients. Greater acute toxicity was seen with AP. Treatment probably contributed to the deaths of eight patients (4%) on the AP arm and five patients (2%) on the WAI arm. Conclusion. Chemotherapy with AP significantly improved progression-free and overall survival compared with WAI. Nevertheless, further advances in efficacy and reduction in toxicity are clearly needed.";Neoplasms;Interventional;Indomain;Train
213;16828196;Divided dose of cisplatin combined with gemcitabine in malignant mesothelioma.;Malignant mesothelioma is a rare but notoriously chemoresistant tumor. An impressive activity of gemcitabine and cisplatin combination in malignant mesothelioma has been shown. However, the hematological toxicity and nephrotoxicity related to this regimen affect the patient's life negatively. The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy and toxicity of divided dose of cisplatin combined with gemcitabine in chemo-naive patients with malignant mesothelioma. Twenty-six eligible patients with malignant mesothelioma were enrolled onto the study. Cisplatin 35 mg/m(2) and gemcitabine 800 mg/m(2) were administered on days 1 and 8 as intravenous infusion in a 3-week cycle, up to maximum 6 cycles. Response and toxicity evaluations were performed in 26 patients. Male-female ratio was 11/15 with a mean age of 50.5 years (37-70). Locations of tumor were pleura in 16 patients, and peritoneum in 10 patients. All patients had epitheloid subtype of malignant mesothelioma. The partial response and stable disease were observed in 6 patients (23.1%) and in 13 patients (50%), respectively, with an overall tumor control rate of 73.1%. Seven patients (26.9%) had progressive disease. Median time to disease progression and survival were 4 and 19.5 months, respectively. Grade 3 nausea and vomiting were observed in one patient (3.8%), grade 4 neutropenia developed in one patient (3.8%) and grades 3-4 thrombocytopenia and nephrotoxicity did not develop. There was no treatment related death. Divided dose of cisplatin combined with gemcitabine, at the current dosage and schedule, appears to be an active regimen in chemotherapy-naive patients with malignant mesothelioma, and well-tolerated.;Neoplasms;Interventional;Indomain;Train

In the randomized, multinational phase II/III trial (V325) of untreated advanced gastric cancer patients, the phase II part selected docetaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil (DCF) over docetaxel and cisplatin for comparison against cisplatin and fluorouracil (CF; reference regimen) in the phase III part. Patients and methods. Advanced gastric cancer patients were randomly assigned to docetaxel 75 mg/m2 and cisplatin 75 mg/m2 (day 1) plus fluorouracil 750 mg/m2/d (days 1 to 5) every 3 weeks or cisplatin 100 mg/m2 (day 1) plus fluorouracil 1,000 mg/m2/d (days 1 to 5) every 4 weeks. The primary end point was time-to-progression (TTP). Results. In 445 randomly assigned and treated patients (DCF = 221; CF = 224), TTP was longer with DCF versus CF (32% risk reduction; log-rank P < .001). Overall survival was longer with DCF versus CF (23% risk reduction; log-rank P = .02). Two-year survival rate was 18% with DCF and 9% with CF. Overall response rate was higher with DCF (chi2 P = .01). Grade 3 to 4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 69% (DCF) v 59% (CF) of patients. Frequent grade 3 to 4 toxicities for DCF v CF were: neutropenia (82% v 57%), stomatitis (21% v 27%), diarrhea (19% v 8%), lethargy (19% v 14%). Complicated neutropenia was more frequent with DCF than CF (29% v 12%). Conclusion. Adding docetaxel to CF significantly improved TTP, survival, and response rate in gastric cancer patients, but resulted in some increase in toxicity. Incorporation of docetaxel, as in DCF or with other active drug(s), is a new therapy option for patients with untreated advanced gastric cancer.";Neoplasms;Interventional;Indomain;Train
215;17215530;Sorafenib in advanced clear-cell renal-cell carcinoma.;"Background. We conducted a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor of tumor-cell proliferation and angiogenesis, in patients with advanced clear-cell renal-cell carcinoma. Methods. From November 2003 to March 2005, we randomly assigned 903 patients with renal-cell carcinoma that was resistant to standard therapy to receive either continuous treatment with oral sorafenib (at a dose of 400 mg twice daily) or placebo; 451 patients received sorafenib and 452 received placebo. The primary end point was overall survival. A single planned analysis of progression-free survival in January 2005 showed a statistically significant benefit of sorafenib over placebo. Consequently, crossover was permitted from placebo to sorafenib, beginning in May 2005. Results. At the January 2005 cutoff, the median progression-free survival was 5.5 months in the sorafenib group and 2.8 months in the placebo group (hazard ratio for disease progression in the sorafenib group, 0.44; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.35 to 0.55; P<0.01). The first interim analysis of overall survival in May 2005 showed that sorafenib reduced the risk of death, as compared with placebo (hazard ratio, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.94; P=0.02), although this benefit was not statistically significant according to the O'Brien-Fleming threshold. Partial responses were reported as the best response in 10% of patients receiving sorafenib and in 2% of those receiving placebo (P<0.001). Diarrhea, rash, fatigue, and hand-foot skin reactions were the most common adverse events associated with sorafenib. Hypertension and cardiac ischemia were rare serious adverse events that were more common in patients receiving sorafenib than in those receiving placebo. Conclusions. As compared with placebo, treatment with sorafenib prolongs progression-free survival in patients with advanced clear-cell renal-cell carcinoma in whom previous therapy has failed; however, treatment is associated with increased toxic effects.

216;17452677;Erlotinib plus gemcitabine compared with gemcitabine alone in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer: a phase III trial of the National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group.;"Purpose. Patients with advanced pancreatic cancer have a poor prognosis and there have been no improvements in survival since the introduction of gemcitabine in 1996. Pancreatic tumors often overexpress human epidermal growth factor receptor type 1 (HER1/EGFR) and this is associated with a worse prognosis. We studied the effects of adding the HER1/EGFR-targeted agent erlotinib to gemcitabine in patients with unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic pancreatic cancer. Patients and methods. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive standard gemcitabine plus erlotinib (100 or 150 mg/d orally) or gemcitabine plus placebo in a double-blind, international phase III trial. The primary end point was overall survival. Results. A total of 569 patients were randomly assigned. Overall survival based on an intent-to-treat analysis was significantly prolonged on the erlotinib/gemcitabine arm with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.82 (95% CI, 0.69 to 0.99; P = .038, adjusted for stratification factors; median 6.24 months v 5.91 months). One-year survival was also greater with erlotinib plus gemcitabine (23% v 17%; P = .023). Progression-free survival was significantly longer with erlotinib plus gemcitabine with an estimated HR of 0.77 (95% CI, 0.64 to 0.92; P = .004). Objective response rates were not significantly different between the arms, although more patients on erlotinib had disease stabilization. There was a higher incidence of some adverse events with erlotinib plus gemcitabine, but most were grade 1 or 2. Conclusion. To our knowledge, this randomized phase III trial is the first to demonstrate statistically significantly improved survival in advanced pancreatic cancer by adding any agent to gemcitabine. The recommended dose of erlotinib with gemcitabine for this indication is 100 mg/d.";Neoplasms;Interventional;Indomain;Train

Previous studies of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia reported high response rates to fludarabine combined with cyclophosphamide. We aimed to establish whether this treatment combination provided greater survival benefit than did chlorambucil or fludarabine. Methods. 777 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia requiring treatment were randomly assigned to fludarabine (n=194) or fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide (196) for six courses, or chlorambucil (387) for 12 courses. The primary endpoint was overall survival, with secondary endpoints of response rates, progression-free survival, toxic effects, and quality of life. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number NCT 58585610. Findings. There was no significant difference in overall survival between patients given fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, or chlorambucil. Complete and overall response rates were better with fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide than with fludarabine (complete response rate 38%vs 15%, respectively; overall response rate 94%vs 80%, respectively; p<0.0001 for both comparisons), which were in turn better than with chlorambucil (complete response rate 7%, overall response rate 72%; p=0.006 and 0.04, respectively). Progression-free survival at 5 years was significantly better with fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide (36%) than with fludarabine (10%) or chlorambucil (10%; p<0.00005). Fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide was the best combination for all ages, including patients older than 70 years, and in prognostic groups defined by immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (V(H)) mutation status and cytogenetics, which were tested in 533 and 579 cases, respectively. Patients had more neutropenia and days in hospital with fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide, or fludarabine, than with chlorambucil. There was less haemolytic anaemia with fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide (5%) than with fludarabine (11%) or chlorambucil (12%). Quality of life was better for responders, but preliminary analyses showed no significant difference between treatments. A meta-analysis of these data and those of two published phase III trials showed a consistent benefit for the fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide regimen in terms of progression-free survival. Interpretation. Fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide should now become the standard treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and the basis for new protocols that incorporate monoclonal antibodies.";Neoplasms;Interventional;Indomain;Train

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the activity and toxicity of carboplatin and paclitaxel combination in advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma. Methods. Forty-seven eligible patients with measurable advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma were treated with carboplatin [area under the curve (AUC) 5] and paclitaxel 175 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks for 6-9 cycles or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Results. There were 10 complete responses (CRs) (21%) and 19 partial responses (PRs) (41%) for an overall response rate (RR) of 62% (29 patients) (95% confidence interval [CI], 47-76%). The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 15 months (95% CI, 7.3-22.7 months) and the median overall survival (OS) was 25 months (95% CI, 19.0-31.0 months). No difference was found in RR and OS in patients with primary advanced disease and those with recurrent tumors. Similarly, no difference was found in PFS and OS for patients with serous/clear tumors and those with endometrioid tumors. Toxicity was generally mild except for myelotoxicity. Neutropenia grade 3/4 was recorded in 36% of patients and 6% experienced febrile neutropenia. One patient each developed grade 4 thrombocytopenia and anemia. Grade 3 sensory neuropathy was recorded in 6% of patients. Conclusion.

To determine whether adding 2 years of androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) improved outcome for patients electively treated with ADT before and during radiation therapy (RT). Patients and methods. Prostate cancer patients with T2c-T4 prostate cancer with no extra pelvic lymph node involvement and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) less than 150 ng/mL were included. All patients received 4 months of goserelin and flutamide before and during RT. They were randomized to no further ADT (short-term ADT [STAD] + RT) or 24 months of goserelin (long-term ADT [LTAD] + RT). A total of 1,554 patients were entered. RT was 45 Gy to the pelvic nodes and 65 to 70 Gy to the prostate. Median follow-up of all survival patients is 11.31 and 11.27 years for the two arms. Results. At 10 years, the LTAD + RT group showed significant improvement over the STAD + RT group for all end points except overall survival: disease-free survival (13.2% v 22.5%; P < .0001), disease-specific survival (83.9% v 88.7%; P = .0042), local progression (22.2% v 12.3%; P < .0001), distant metastasis (22.8% v 14.8%; P < .0001), biochemical failure (68.1% v 51.9%; P <or= .0001), and overall survival (51.6% v 53.9%, P = .36). One subgroup analyzed consisted of all cancers with a Gleason score of 8 to 10 cancers. An overall survival difference was observed (31.9% v 45.1%; P = .0061), as well as in all other end points herein. Conclusion. LTAD as delivered in this study for the treatment of locally advanced prostate cancer is superior to STAD for all end points except survival. A survival advantage for LTAD + RT in the treatment of locally advanced tumors with a Gleason score of 8 to 10 suggests that this should be the standard of treatment for these high-risk patients.";Neoplasms;Interventional;Indomain;Train
220;19091394;Endocrine treatment, with or without radiotherapy, in locally advanced prostate cancer (SPCG-7/SFUO-3): an open randomised phase III trial.;"Background. Several studies have shown the efficacy of endocrine therapy in combination with radiotherapy in high-risk prostate cancer. To assess the effect of radiotherapy, we did an open phase III study comparing endocrine therapy with and without local radiotherapy, followed by castration on progression. Methods. This randomised trial included men from 47 centres in Norway, Sweden, and Denmark. Between February, 1996, and December, 2002, 875 patients with locally advanced prostate cancer (T3; 78%; PSA<70; N0; M0) were centrally randomly assigned by computer to endocrine treatment alone (3 months of total androgen blockade followed by continuous endocrine treatment using flutamide; 439 patients), or to the same endocrine treatment combined with radiotherapy (436 patients). The primary endpoint was prostate-cancer-specific survival, and analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered as an international standard randomised controlled trial, number ISRCTN01534787. Findings. After a median follow-up of 7.6 years, 79 men in the endocrine alone group and 37 men in the endocrine plus radiotherapy group had died of prostate cancer. The cumulative incidence at 10 years for prostate-cancer-specific mortality was 23.9% in the endocrine alone group and 11.9% in the endocrine plus radiotherapy group (difference 12.0%, 95% CI 4.9-19.1%), for a relative risk of 0.44 (0.30-0.66). At 10 years, the cumulative incidence for overall mortality was 39.4% in the endocrine alone group and 29.6% in the endocrine plus radiotherapy group (difference 9.8%, 0.8-18.8%), for a relative risk of 0.68 (0.52-0.89). Cumulative incidence at 10 years for PSA recurrence was substantially higher in men in the endocrine-alone group (74.7%vs 25.9%, p<0.0001; HR 0.16; 0.12-0.20). After 5 years, urinary, rectal, and sexual problems were slightly more frequent in the endocrine plus radiotherapy group. Interpretation. In patients with locally advanced or high-risk local prostate cancer, addition of local radiotherapy to endocrine treatment halved the 10-year prostate-cancer-specific mortality, and substantially decreased overall mortality with fully acceptable risk of side-effects compared with endocrine treatment alone. In the light of these data, endocrine treatment plus radiotherapy should be the new standard.";Neoplasms;Interventional;Indomain;Train

Vascular endothelial growth factor is a key promoter of tumor progression in cervical carcinoma. The Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) conducted a phase II trial to assess the efficacy and tolerability of bevacizumab, a recombinant humanized anti-vascular endothelial growth factor monoclonal antibody. Patients and methods. Eligible patients had recurrent cervical cancer, measurable disease, and GOG performance status < or = 2. Treatment consisted of bevacizumab 15 mg/kg intravenously every 21 days until disease progression or prohibitive toxicity. Primary end points were progression-free survival (PFS) at 6 months and toxicity. Results. Forty-six patients were enrolled (median age, 46 years); 38 patients (82.6%) received prior radiation as well as either one (n = 34, 73.9%) or two (n = 12, 26.1%) prior cytotoxic regimens for recurrent disease.

Treatment with gemcitabine provides modest benefits in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. The addition of erlotinib to gemcitabine shows a small but significant improvement in overall survival (OS) versus gemcitabine alone. Phase II results for bevacizumab plus gemcitabine provided the rationale for a phase III trial of gemcitabine-erlotinib plus bevacizumab or placebo. Patients and methods. Patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma were randomly assigned to receive gemcitabine (1,000 mg/m(2)/week), erlotinib (100 mg/day), and bevacizumab (5 mg/kg every 2 weeks) or gemcitabine, erlotinib, and placebo in this double-blind, phase III trial. Primary end point was OS; secondary end points included progression-free survival (PFS), disease control rate, and safety. Results. A total of 301 patients were randomly assigned to the placebo group and 306 to the bevacizumab group. Median OS was 7.1 and 6.0 months in the bevacizumab and placebo arms, respectively (hazard ratio [HR], 0.89; 95% CI, 0.74 to 1.07; P = .2087); this difference was not statistically significant.

Therapy. 2 cycles of induction chemotherapy (cisplatin and docetaxel, both 75 mg/m(2) 3-weekly) followed by chemoradiation therapy (CRT) comprising a total radiation dose of 59.4 Gy together with docetaxel 15 mg/m(2) and cisplatin 25 mg/m(2) (5 weekly doses). Primary endpoint: Histologically proven freedom from local failure 6 months after CRT completion. Results. 21 patients were included: 12 had locally very advanced tumors, 3 had cervical esophagus tumors, and 6 were medically unfit for surgery. 18 patients completed therapy per protocol. Grade 3/4 toxicities during CRT were thrombopenia (10%) and dysphagia (15%). 1 patient died due to herpes simplex infection. The primary endpoint was achieved by 4 patients, 6 were alive after median follow-up of 34 months, and median survival was 16 months. Most patients experienced lasting improvement of dysphagia following induction chemotherapy. Conclusions. This regimen is feasible, showed clinically meaningful, long-lasting improvements in quality of life and resulted in long-term survival in 29% of the patients.;Neoplasms;Interventional;Indomain;Train
224;20846715;Randomized phase III trial of tamoxifen versus thalidomide in women with biochemical-recurrent-only epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal carcinoma after a complete response to first-line platinum/taxane chemotherapy with an evaluation of serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF): A Gynecologic Oncology Group Study.;Purpose. To compare progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and toxicities of thalidomide versus tamoxifen and to evaluate serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in biochemical-recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal cancer or fallopian tube carcinoma (EOC/PPC/FTC). Methods. Biochemical recurrence was defined as a rising CA-125 exceeding twice the upper limit of normal without evidence of disease as defined by RECIST 1.0 criteria. Women with FIGO stages III and IV, histologically confirmed EOC/PPC/FTC who were free of disease following first-line chemotherapy were randomized to oral thalidomide 200mg daily with escalation to a maximum of 400 mg or tamoxifen 20mg orally twice daily for up to 1 year, progression or adverse effect prohibited further treatment. VEGF was quantified by ELISA in pre and post-treatment serum. Results. Of the 139 women randomized, 138 were eligible. Interim analysis showed that thalidomide did not reduce the recurrence rate relative to tamoxifen, and the trial was closed. Thalidomide versus tamoxifen was associated with a similar risk of progression (HR = 1.31, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.93-1.85), an increased risk of death (HR = 1.76, 95% CI = 1.16-2.68) and more grades 3 and 4 toxicities (55% versus 3%). The most common grades 3 and 4 toxicities were constitutional (12%), somnolence (12%), pulmonary (9%), venous thromboembolism (VTE) (6%) and peripheral neurologic (6%) for thalidomide, with VTE (1.4%) and gastrointestinal (1.4%) for tamoxifen. Serum VEGF was not associated with clinical characteristics, treatment, PFS or OS. Conclusion. Thalidomide was not more effective than tamoxifen in delaying recurrence or death but was more toxic. VEGF was not prognostic in this cohort.;Neoplasms;Interventional;Indomain;Train
225;21410371;Cytarabine dose for acute myeloid leukemia.;Background. Cytarabine (ara-C) is an important drug in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). High-dose cytarabine (2000 to 3000 mg per square meter of body-surface area) is toxic but results in higher rates of relapse-free survival than does the conventional dose of 100 to 400 mg per square meter. Intermediate dose levels have not been thoroughly evaluated. Methods. We compared two induction regimens in patients 18 to 60 years of age (median, 49) who had newly diagnosed AML. The intermediate-dose group, totaling 431 patients, received cytarabine at a dose of 200 mg per square meter given by continuous intravenous infusion for 24 hours during cycle 1 of induction therapy and 1000 mg per square meter by infusion for 3 hours twice daily during cycle 2 of induction therapy. The high-dose group, totaling 429 patients, received a dose-escalated regimen of 1000 mg of cytarabine per square meter every 12 hours in cycle 1 and 2000 mg per square meter twice daily in cycle 2. Patients with a complete response did not receive additional cytarabine but received consolidation therapy in a third cycle of chemotherapy (mitoxantrone-etoposide) or underwent autologous or allogeneic stem-cell transplantation. Complete remission rates, survival rates, and toxic effects were assessed for each treatment group. Results. At a median follow-up of 5 years, no significant differences were noted between the intermediate-dose group and the high-dose group with respect to complete remission rates (80% and 82%, respectively), probability of relapse, event-free survival at 5 years (34% and 35%), or overall survival (40% and 42%). High-dose cytarabine provided no clear advantage in any prognostic subgroup. The high-dose treatment resulted in higher incidences of grade 3 and grade 4 toxic effects (in cycle 1), prolonged hospitalization, and delayed neutrophil recovery (in cycle 2) and platelet recovery (in cycles 2 and 3). Conclusions. Induction therapy with cytarabine at the lower dose already produced maximal antileukemic effects for all response end points, suggesting a plateau in the dose-response relationship above this dose level. High-dose cytarabine results in excessive toxic effects without therapeutic benefit. (Netherlands Trial Register number, NTR230.).;Neoplasms;Interventional;Indomain;Train
226;21680153;Pharmacokinetics of eslicarbazepine acetate at steady-state in adults with partial-onset seizures.;"Objective. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of eslicarbazepine acetate (ESL) at steady-state in adults with partial-onset seizures who have taken ESL for at least 1 year with one or two concomitant antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Methods. Blood samples for the pharmacokinetic assessment were taken at pre-dose, and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24h post-dose at steady-state in 51 patients stabilised on chronic (beyond 1 year) treatment with ESL 400mg (n=7), 800mg (n=26) or 1200mg (n=18) once-daily. Most patients (n=29, 56.9%) were receiving 2 concomitant AEDs, and most frequent co-medications were carbamazepine (n=34, 66.7%) and valproic acid (n=19, 37.3%). Plasma concentrations of ESL and its metabolites eslicarbazepine, R-licarbazepine and oxcarbazepine (OXC) were determined by a validated chiral method using liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. Results. Similarly to earlier findings in healthy subjects, plasma ESL concentrations were consistently below the lower limit of quantification (50ng/mL). The major compound in plasma was the active metabolite eslicarbazepine, which reached maximum concentrations (C(max)) 2h post-dose; thereafter, its plasma concentrations declined with a mean apparent half-life of 13, 14, and 20h in patients receiving ESL doses of 400, 800, and 1200mg once daily, respectively. Eslicarbazepine C(max) were 9.7, 15.5 and 23.0μg/mL, and areas under the plasma concentration-time curve over the dosing interval (AUC(0-24)) were 132.5, 205.4 and 336.1μgh/mL in patients receiving ESL doses of 400, 800 and 1200mg once-daily, respectively. Eslicarbazepine main pharmacokinetic parameters (C(max) and AUC(0-24)) were dose-proportional. R-licarbazepine and OXC were minor metabolites. Conclusions. Following once-daily oral administration of ESL 400mg, 800mg and 1200mg to epilepsy patients treated concomitantly with one or two other AEDs, ESL was rapidly converted to eslicarbazepine, which was the primary active compound found in plasma. Systemic exposure to eslicarbazepine was dose-proportional.";Neoplasms;Interventional;Indomain;Train
227;21883097;Tolerability and safety of perampanel: two randomized dose-escalation studies.;"Objectives. To evaluate, for the first time in patients with epilepsy, the tolerability and safety of escalating doses of oral perampanel, a novel, selective, non-competitive AMPA antagonist, as adjunctive therapy for refractory partial-onset seizures. Materials and methods. Two consecutive, randomized, double-blind, dose-escalation studies recruited adults (18-70 years) with uncontrolled partial-onset seizures receiving one to three concomitant antiepileptic drugs. In study 206, patients were treated for 12 weeks (8-week dose-titration, 4-week dose-maintenance) with placebo or perampanel (up to 4 mg/day, dosed once- or twice-daily). In study 208, patients received placebo or perampanel once-daily (up to 12 mg) for 16 weeks (12-week titration, 4-week maintenance). Results. Overall, 153 patients were randomized into study 206 (perampanel twice-daily, n = 51; perampanel once-daily, n = 51; placebo, n = 51). Study 208 included 48 patients (perampanel once-daily, n = 38; placebo, n = 10). The highest dose in study 206 - 4 mg/day - was well tolerated, with similar proportions of patients tolerating once-daily (82.4%) and twice-daily (82.4%) perampanel and placebo (82.4%) treatments. In study 208 most patients tolerated doses of ≥ 6 mg perampanel once-daily in a Kaplan-Meier analysis. In both studies, the most common adverse events were CNS-related; most were of mild/moderate severity. Conclusions. Perampanel was well tolerated across doses of 4-12 mg/day. The studies showed preliminary evidence of efficacy and identified doses to be evaluated in larger clinical studies.";Neoplasms;Interventional;Indomain;Train
228;22056152;Combined androgen deprivation therapy and radiation therapy for locally advanced prostate cancer: a randomised, phase 3 trial.;"Background. Whether the addition of radiation therapy (RT) improves overall survival in men with locally advanced prostate cancer managed with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is unclear. Our aim was to compare outcomes in such patients with locally advanced prostate cancer. Methods. Patients with: locally advanced (T3 or T4) prostate cancer (n=1057); or organ-confined disease (T2) with either a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentration more than 40 ng/mL (n=119) or PSA concentration more than 20 ng/mL and a Gleason score of 8 or higher (n=25), were randomly assigned (done centrally with stratification and dynamic minimisation, not masked) to receive lifelong ADT and RT (65-69 Gy to the prostate and seminal vesicles, 45 Gy to the pelvic nodes). The primary endpoint was overall survival. The results presented here are of an interim analysis planned for when two-thirds of the events for the final analysis were recorded. All efficacy analyses were done by intention to treat and were based on data from all patients. This trial is registered at controlledtrials.com as ISRCTN24991896 and Clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00002633. Results. Between 1995 and 2005, 1205 patients were randomly assigned (602 in the ADT only group and 603 in the ADT and RT group); median follow-up was 6·0 years (IQR 4·4-8·0). At the time of analysis, a total of 320 patients had died, 175 in the ADT only group and 145 in the ADT and RT group. The addition of RT to ADT improved overall survival at 7 years (74%, 95% CI 70-78 vs 66%, 60-70; hazard ratio [HR] 0·77, 95% CI 0·61-0·98, p=0·033). Both toxicity and health-related quality-of-life results showed a small effect of RT on late gastrointestinal toxicity (rectal bleeding grade >3, three patients (0·5%) in the ADT only group, two (0·3%) in the ADT and RT group; diarrhoea grade >3, four patients (0·7%) vs eight (1·3%); urinary toxicity grade >3, 14 patients (2·3%) in both groups). Interpretation. The benefits of combined modality treatment--ADT and RT--should be discussed with all patients with locally advanced prostate cancer. Funding.

Olaparib (AZD2281), an orally active poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor that induces synthetic lethality in BRCA1- or BRCA2-deficient cells, has shown promising clinical efficacy in nonrandomized phase II trials in patients with ovarian cancer with BRCA1 or BRCA2 deficiency. We assessed the comparative efficacy and safety of olaparib and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) in this patient population. Patients and methods. In this multicenter, open-label, randomized, phase II study, patients with ovarian cancer that recurred within 12 months of prior platinum therapy and with confirmed germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations were enrolled. Patients were assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to olaparib 200 mg twice per day or 400 mg twice per day continuously or PLD 50 mg/m(2) intravenously every 28 days. The primary efficacy end point was Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) -assessed progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary end points included objective response rate (ORR) and safety. Results. Ninety-seven patients were randomly assigned. Median PFS was 6.5 months (95% CI, 5.5 to 10.1 months), 8.8 months (95% CI, 5.4 to 9.2 months), and 7.1 months (95% CI, 3.7 to 10.7 months) for the olaparib 200 mg, olaparib 400 mg, and PLD groups, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in PFS (hazard ratio, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.51 to 1.56; P = .66) for combined olaparib doses versus PLD. RECIST-assessed ORRs were 25%, 31%, and 18% for olaparib 200 mg, olaparib 400 mg, and PLD, respectively; differences were not statistically significant. Tolerability of both treatments was as expected based on previous trials. Conclusion. The efficacy of olaparib was consistent with previous studies. However, the efficacy of PLD was greater than expected. Olaparib 400 mg twice per day is a suitable dose to explore in further studies in this patient population.";Neoplasms;Interventional;Indomain;Test
230;22370319;Randomized phase III study comparing paclitaxel/cisplatin/gemcitabine and gemcitabine/cisplatin in patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer without prior systemic therapy: EORTC Intergroup Study 30987.;"Purpose. The combination of gemcitabine plus cisplatin (GC) is a standard regimen in patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer. A phase I/II study suggested that a three-drug regimen that included paclitaxel had greater antitumor activity and might improve survival. Patients and methods. We conducted a randomized phase III study to compare paclitaxel/cisplatin/gemcitabine (PCG) with GC in patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma. Primary outcome was overall survival (OS). Secondary outcomes were progression-free survival (PFS), overall response rate, and toxicity. Results. From 2001 to 2004, 626 patients were randomly assigned; 312 patients were assigned to PCG, and 314 patients were assigned to GC. After a median follow-up of 4.6 years, the median OS was 15.8 months on PCG versus 12.7 months on GC (hazard ratio [HR], 0.85; P = .075). OS in the subgroup of all eligible patients was significantly longer on PCG (3.2 months; HR, 0.82; P = .03), as was the case in patients with bladder primary tumors. PFS was not significantly longer on PCG (HR, 0.87; P = .11). Overall response rate was 55.5% on PCG and 43.6% on GC (P = .0031). Both treatments were well tolerated, with more thrombocytopenia and bleeding on GC than PCG (11.4% v 6.8%, respectively; P = .05) and more febrile neutropenia on PCG than GC (13.2% v 4.3%, respectively; P < .001). Conclusion. The addition of paclitaxel to GC provides a higher response rate and a 3.1-month survival benefit that did not reach statistical significance. Novel approaches will be required to obtain major improvements in survival of incurable urothelial cancer.";Neoplasms;Interventional;Indomain;Train

There is no universally accepted and effective prophylaxis of migraine headache episodes. We aimed to investigate the effects of Lippia alba (Mill.) N. E. Brown (chemotype geranial-carvenone) in the treatment of migraine patients. Methods. Twenty-one women were enrolled in a prospective, phase 2, non-controlled cohort study to orally receive hydroethanolic extract of L. alba leaves. Symptom intensity and impact were assessed using MIDAS and HIT-6 instruments before and after 2 months of treatment. Results. We observed a significant decrease on HIT-6 total score, as well as MIDAS number of missed days, number of headache days, and pain intensity. More than 70% of patients experienced a minimum 50% reduction on pain frequency. Conclusions. Treatment with L. alba leaves (geranial-carvenone) hydroethanolic extract is a cheap, safe, widely available, highly effective therapy to reduce both the intensity and the frequency of headache episodes of women with migraine.

232;23690416;Randomized international phase III trial of ERCC1 and RRM1 expression-based chemotherapy versus gemcitabine/carboplatin in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer.;Purpose. We assessed whether chemotherapy selection based on in situ ERCC1 and RRM1 protein levels would improve survival in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients and methods. Eligible patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to the trial's experimental arm, which consisted of gemcitabine/carboplatin if RRM1 and ERCC1 were low, docetaxel/carboplatin if RRM1 was high and ERCC1 was low, gemcitabine/docetaxel if RRM1 was low and ERCC1 was high, and docetaxel/vinorelbine if both were high. In the control arm, patients received gemcitabine/carboplatin. The trial was powered for a 32% improvement in 6-month progression-free survival (PFS). Results. Of 331 patients registered, 275 were eligible. The median number of cycles given was four in both arms. A tumor rebiopsy specifically for expression analysis was required in 17% of patients. The median time from informed consent to expression analysis was 11 days. We found no statistically significant differences between the experimental arm and the control arm in PFS (6.1 months v 6.9 months) or overall survival (11.0 months v 11.3 months). A subset analysis revealed that patients with low levels for both proteins who received the same treatment in both treatment arms had a statistically better PFS (P = .02) in the control arm (8.1 months) compared with the experimental arm (5.0 months). Conclusion. This demonstrates that protein expression analysis for therapeutic decision making is feasible in newly diagnosed patients with advanced-stage NSCLC. A tumor rebiopsy is safe, required in 17%, and acceptable to 89% (47 of 53) of patients.;Neoplasms;Interventional;Indomain;Train

Patients with newly diagnosed, relapsed, or primary refractory myeloma were enrolled in a randomized phase II trial of 2 reduced-intensity conditioning regimens: fludarabine 120 mg/m(2) + melphalan 100 mg/m(2) (FM100) versus fludarabine 120 mg/m(2) + melphalan 140 mg/m(2) (FM140) before allo-HCT from related or unrelated donors. Fifty patients underwent allo-HCT using FM100 (n = 23) or FM140 (n = 27) conditioning between April 2002 and 2011. There were no significant differences between FM100 and FM140 in time to neutrophil engraftment (P = .21), acute grade II to IV graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (P = 1.0), chronic GVHD (P = .24), response rate (P = 1.0), TRM (13% versus 15%, P = 1.0), median progression-free survival (PFS), 11.7 versus 8.4 months, P = .12, and median overall survival (OS), 35.1 versus 19.7 months, P = .38. Cumulative incidence of disease progression in FM100 and FM140 was 43% and 70%, respectively (P = .08). Recurrent disease was the most common cause of death for both FM100 (26%) and FM140 (44%), P = .24. On multivariate analysis, disease status at allo-HCT, complete response or very good partial response (VGPR) was significantly associated with longer PFS (15.6 versus 9.6 months in patients with <VGPR, P = .05). OS was similar across all variables. We conclude that FM100 and FM140 may result in similar patient outcomes after allo-HCT for MM.";Neoplasms;Interventional;Indomain;Train
234;24332514;Oral ibandronic acid versus intravenous zoledronic acid in treatment of bone metastases from breast cancer: a randomised, open label, non-inferiority phase 3 trial.;"Background. Bisphosphonates are routinely used in the treatment of metastatic bone disease from breast cancer to reduce pain and bone destruction. Zoledronic acid given by intravenous infusion has been widely used, but places a substantial logistical burden on both patient and hospital. As a result, the use of oral ibandronic acid has increased, despite the absence of comparative data. In the ZICE trial, we compared oral ibandronic acid with intravenous zoledronic acid for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer to bone. Methods. This phase 3, open-label, parallel group active-controlled, multicentre, randomised, non-inferiority phase 3 study was done in 99 UK hospitals. Eligibility criteria included at least one radiologically confirmed bone metastasis from a histologically confirmed breast cancer. Patients with ECOG performance status 0 to 2 and clinical decision to treat with bisphosphonates within 3 months of randomisation were randomly assigned to receive 96 weeks of treatment with either intravenous zoledronic acid at 4 mg every 3-4 weeks or oral ibandronic acid 50 mg daily. Randomisation (1:1) was done via a central computerised system within stratified block sizes of four. Randomisation was stratified on whether patients had current or planned treatment with chemotherapy; current or planned treatment with hormone therapy; and whether they had a previous skeletal-related event within the last 3 months or had planned radiotherapy treatment to the bone or planned orthopaedic surgery due to bone metastases. The primary non-inferiority endpoint was the frequency and timing of skeletal-related events over 96 weeks, analysed using a per-protocol analysis. All active (non-withdrawn) patients have now reached the 96-week timepoint and the trial is now in long-term follow-up. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00326820. Findings. Between Jan 13, 2006, and Oct 4, 2010, 705 patients were randomly assigned to receive ibandronic acid and 699 to receive zoledronic acid; three patients withdrew immediately after randomisation. The per-protocol analysis included 654 patients in the ibandronic acid group and 672 in the zoledronic acid group. Annual rates of skeletal-related events were 0·499 (95% CI 0·454-0·549) with ibandronic acid and 0·435 (0·393-0·480) with zoledronic acid; the rate ratio for skeletal-related events was 1·148 (95% CI 0·967-1·362). The upper CI was greater than the margin of non-inferiority of 1·08; therefore, we could not reject the null hypothesis that ibandronic acid was inferior to zoledronic acid. More patients in the zoledronic acid group had renal toxic effects than in the ibandronic acid group (226 [32%] of 697 vs 172 [24%] of 704) but rates of osteonecrosis of the jaw were low in both groups (nine [1%] of 697 vs five [<1%] of 704). The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were fatigue (97 [14%] of 697 patients allocated zoledronic acid vs 98 [14%] of 704 allocated ibandronic acid), increased bone pain (91 [corrected] [13%] vs 85 [corrected] [12%]), joint pain (41 [corrected] [6%] vs 38 [5%]), infection (31 [5%] vs 23 [corrected] [3%]), and nausea or vomiting (38 [5%] vs 41 [6%]). Interpretation. Our results suggest that zoledronic acid is preferable to ibandronic acid in preventing skeletal-related events caused by bone metastases. However, both drugs have acceptable side-effect profiles and the oral formulation is more convenient, and could still be considered if the patient has a strong preference or if difficulties occur with intravenous infusions.

235;24419420;Phase II study of perioperative chemotherapy with cisplatin and pemetrexed in non-small-cell lung cancer.;Introduction. Pathologic complete response (pCR) with neoadjuvant chemotherapy is associated with improved survival in many solid tumors. We evaluated pCR rate of cisplatin with pemetrexed in non-small-cell lung cancer. Methods. Patients with stages IB to IIIA non-small-cell lung cancer, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 to 1 were enrolled in this single-arm phase II trial using two-stage design with 90% power to detect pCR rate of more than or equal to 10%. Pretreatment mediastinal lymph node biopsy was required. Patients received three cycles of cisplatin 75 mg/m with pemetrexed 500 mg/m (day 1 every 21 days) preoperatively and additional two cycles within 60 to 80 days after surgery. The primary end point was pCR. Polymorphisms in FPGS, GGH, SLC19A1, and TYMS genes were correlated with treatment outcomes. Results. Thirty-eight patients were enrolled, with median age of 62.5 years. Preoperatively, 26% had squamous histology, and 34% had biopsy-proven N2 involvement. R0 resection was achieved in 94% of the 34 patients who underwent surgery, and 54% had documented N2 clearance. There was no pCR seen. Median disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival of these patients have not yet been reached in contrast to median of 13.8 and 24.2 months, respectively, in patients with persistent N2 disease (p = 0.3241 and p = 0.1022, respectively). There was a statistically significant association between DFS and postoperative tumor, node, metastasis stage (p = 0.0429), SLC19A1 rs3788189 TT genotype (p = 0.0821), and viable tumor defined as less than or equal to 10% of resected specimen (p = 0.026). Conclusion. The primary end point was not met. Patients with N2 clearance, less than or equal to 10% viable tumor in the resected specimen, and SLC19A1 rs3788189 TT genotype have favorable DFS outcomes.;Neoplasms;Interventional;Indomain;Train

However, this therapy is limited by ch14.18-related toxicities that may be partially mediated by complement activation. We report the results of a phase I trial to determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD), safety profile, and pharmacokinetics of hu14.18K322A, a humanized anti-GD2 mAb with a single point mutation (K322A) that reduces complement-dependent lysis. Patients and methods. Eligible patients with refractory or recurrent neuroblastoma received escalating doses of hu14.18K322A ranging from 2 to 70 mg/m(2) per day for 4 consecutive days every 28 days (one course). Results. Thirty-eight patients (23 males; median age, 7.2 years) received a median of two courses (range, one to 15). Dose-limiting grade 3 or 4 toxicities occurred in four of 36 evaluable patients and were characterized by cough, asthenia, sensory neuropathy, anorexia, serum sickness, and hypertensive encephalopathy. The most common non-dose-limiting grade 3 or 4 toxicities during course one were pain (68%) and fever (21%). Six of 31 patients evaluable for response by iodine-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine score had objective responses (four complete responses; two partial responses). The first-course pharmacokinetics of hu14.18K322A were best described by a two-compartment linear model. Median hu14.18K322A α (initial phase) and β (terminal phase) half-lives were 1.74 and 21.1 days, respectively. Conclusion. The MTD, and recommended phase II dose, of hu14.18K322A is 60 mg/m(2) per day for 4 days.

In this multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial (DECISION), we investigated sorafenib (400 mg orally twice daily) in patients with radioactive iodine-refractory locally advanced or metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer that had progressed within the past 14 months. Adult patients (≥18 years of age) with this type of cancer were enrolled from 77 centres in 18 countries. To be eligible for inclusion, participants had to have at least one measurable lesion by CT or MRI according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST); Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-2; adequate bone marrow, liver, and renal function; and serum thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration lower than 0·5 mIU/L. An interactive voice response system was used to randomly allocate participants in a 1:1 ratio to either sorafenib or matching placebo. Patients, investigators, and the study sponsor were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival, assessed every 8 weeks by central independent review. Analysis was by intention to treat. Patients in the placebo group could cross over to open-label sorafenib upon disease progression. Archival tumour tissue was examined for BRAF and RAS mutations, and serum thyroglobulin was measured at baseline and at each visit. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00984282, and with the EU Clinical Trials Register, number EudraCT 2009-012007-25. Findings. Patients were randomly allocated on a 1:1 basis to sorafenib or placebo. The intention-to-treat population comprised 417 patients (207 in the sorafenib group and 210 in the placebo group) and the safety population was 416 patients (207 in the sorafenib group and 209 in the placebo group). Median progression-free survival was significantly longer in the sorafenib group (10·8 months) than in the placebo group (5·8 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0·59, 95% CI 0·45-0·76; p<0·0001). Progression-free survival improved in all prespecified clinical and genetic biomarker subgroups, irrespective of mutation status. Adverse events occurred in 204 of 207 (98·6%) patients receiving sorafenib during the double-blind period and in 183 of 209 (87·6%) patients receiving placebo. Most adverse events were grade 1 or 2. The most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events in the sorafenib group were hand-foot skin reaction (76·3%), diarrhoea (68·6%), alopecia (67·1%), and rash or desquamation (50·2%). Interpretation. Sorafenib significantly improved progression-free survival compared with placebo in patients with progressive radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer. Adverse events were consistent with the known safety profile of sorafenib. These results suggest that sorafenib is a new treatment option for patients with progressive radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer. Funding.

238;25042202;Combination of ibrutinib with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) for treatment-naive patients with CD20-positive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma: a non-randomised, phase 1b study.;"Background. Present first-line therapy for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, a subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, is rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP). Ibrutinib, a novel oral Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has shown single-drug activity in relapsed or refractory B-cell malignancies. We investigated the safety and efficacy of ibrutinib in combination with R-CHOP for patients with previously untreated CD20-positive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Methods. In this phase 1b, open-label, non-randomised study, patients were recruited across six centres in the USA and France. Eligibility was age 18 years or older and treatment-naive histopathologically confirmed CD20-positive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. In the dose-escalation phase (part 1), patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, mantle-cell lymphoma, or follicular lymphoma were enrolled. The primary objective was to determine a recommended phase 2 dose of ibrutinib with a standard R-CHOP regimen, by assessing safety in all patients who received treatment. Patients received ibrutinib 280 mg, 420 mg, or 560 mg per day in combination with a standard R-CHOP regimen every 21 days. Safety of the recommended phase 2 dose was then assessed in a dose-expansion population, which consisted of patients with newly diagnosed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (part 2). Secondary objectives included assessments of the proportion of patients who had an overall response, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01569750. Findings. From June 22, 2012, to March 25, 2013, 33 patients were enrolled (part 1: 17; part 2: 16) and 32 received ibrutinib plus R-CHOP treatment (one patient in the part 2 cohort withdrew). The maximum tolerated dose was not reached and the recommended phase 2 dose for ibrutinib was 560 mg per day. The most common grade 3 or greater adverse events included neutropenia (73% [24 of 33 patients]), thrombocytopenia (21% [seven patients]), and febrile neutropenia and anaemia (18% each [six patients]). The most frequently reported serious adverse events were febrile neutropenia (18% [six patients]) and hypotension (6% [two patients]). 30 (94%) of 32 patients who received one or more doses of combination treatment achieved an overall response. All 18 patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who received the recommended phase 2 dose had an overall response. For those subtyped and treated at the recommended phase 2 dose, five (71%) of seven patients with the germinal centre B-cell-like subtype and two (100%) patients with the non-germinal centre B-cell-like subtype had a complete response. R-CHOP did not affect pharmacokinetics of ibrutinib, and ibrutinib did not alter the pharmacokinetics of vincristine. Pharmacodynamic data showed Bruton's tyrosine kinase was fully occupied (>90% occupancy) at the recommended phase 2 dose. Interpretation. Ibrutinib is well tolerated when added to R-CHOP, and could improve responses in patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, but our findings need confirmation in a phase 3 trial. Funding.

239;25122437;Biomarker analyses from a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase IIIb trial comparing bevacizumab with or without erlotinib as maintenance therapy for the treatment of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (ATLAS).;"Introduction. ATLAS compared bevacizumab plus erlotinib (B+E) with bevacizumab plus placebo (B+P) as maintenance therapy after first-line bevacizumab plus chemotherapy (B+C) for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Prespecified biomarkers were prospectively evaluated. Methods. Tumor samples were analyzed for: epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression (immunohistochemistry [IHC]); EGFR gene copy number (fluorescence in-situ hybridization [FISH]); EGFR mutations (exon 19 deletions/L858R mutations); and KRAS mutations (exons 2/3). Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated. Results. Of 743 patients randomized to receive maintenance treatment (after four cycles of B+C without progression), 190 (B+E) and 177 (B+P) were evaluable for biomarker status. Median PFS (from randomization) was 4.4 months (B+E) versus 3.7 months (B+P; hazard ratio [HR], 0.75; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.57-0.99), which was numerically similar to the intent-to-treat PFS. PFS benefit of B+E was observed across most biomarker subgroups. EGFR IHC, EGFR FISH, and EGFR/KRAS mutation status were not predictive of outcome. B+E-treated patients with EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC had longer PFS compared with B+P-treated patients (HR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.22-0.86; p = 0.0139). Patients with KRAS wild-type disease had significant PFS improvements with B+E, compared with B+P (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.485-0.914; p = 0.0105). No OS benefit of B+E was observed. Conclusions. Patients with KRAS wild-type or EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC derived PFS benefits from B+E. However, EGFR IHC, EGFR FISH, and EGFR or KRAS mutation status were not strongly predictive of survival. A larger sample size would be needed to confirm the initial trends observed in this study.";Neoplasms;Interventional;Indomain;Train
240;25240821;Ramucirumab plus paclitaxel versus placebo plus paclitaxel in patients with previously treated advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma (RAINBOW): a double-blind, randomised phase 3 trial.;"Background. VEGFR-2 has a role in gastric cancer pathogenesis and progression. We assessed whether ramucirumab, a monoclonal antibody VEGFR-2 antagonist, in combination with paclitaxel would increase overall survival in patients previously treated for advanced gastric cancer compared with placebo plus paclitaxel. Methods. This randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase 3 trial was done at 170 centres in 27 countries in North and South America, Europe, Asia, and Australia. Patients aged 18 years or older with advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma and disease progression on or within 4 months after first-line chemotherapy (platinum plus fluoropyrimidine with or without an anthracycline) were randomly assigned with a centralised interactive voice or web-response system in a 1:1 ratio to receive ramucirumab 8 mg/kg or placebo intravenously on days 1 and 15, plus paclitaxel 80 mg/m(2) intravenously on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle. A permuted block randomisation, stratified by geographic region, time to progression on first-line therapy, and disease measurability, was used. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Efficacy analysis was by intention to treat, and safety analysis included all patients who received at least one treatment with study drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01170663, and has been completed; patients who are still receiving treatment are in the extension phase. Findings. Between Dec 23, 2010, and Sept 23, 2012, 665 patients were randomly assigned to treatment-330 to ramucirumab plus paclitaxel and 335 to placebo plus paclitaxel. Overall survival was significantly longer in the ramucirumab plus paclitaxel group than in the placebo plus paclitaxel group (median 9·6 months [95% CI 8·5-10·8] vs 7·4 months [95% CI 6·3-8·4], hazard ratio 0·807 [95% CI 0·678-0·962]; p=0·017). Grade 3 or higher adverse events that occurred in more than 5% of patients in the ramucirumab plus paclitaxel group versus placebo plus paclitaxel included neutropenia (133 [41%] of 327 vs 62 [19%] of 329), leucopenia (57 [17%] vs 22 [7%]), hypertension (46 [14%] vs eight [2%]), fatigue (39 [12%] vs 18 [5%]), anaemia (30 [9%] vs 34 [10%]), and abdominal pain (20 [6%] vs 11 [3%]). The incidence of grade 3 or higher febrile neutropenia was low in both groups (ten [3%] vs eight [2%]). Interpretation. The combination of ramucirumab with paclitaxel significantly increases overall survival compared with placebo plus paclitaxel, and could be regarded as a new standard second-line treatment for patients with advanced gastric cancer.

241;25485782;A phase II trial of paclitaxel, carboplatin, and bevacizumab in advanced and recurrent endometrial carcinoma (EMCA).;Objective. To evaluate the effect of adding bevacizumab to adjuvant paclitaxel and carboplatin and as maintenance on progression-free survival (PFS) in advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma (EMCA). Methods. A phase II trial was conducted in patients with measurable disease. Paclitaxel (175mg/m(2)/3h), carboplatin (AUC 5) and bevacizumab (15mg/kg) were administered q 21 days. Patients with a complete response after 6-8cycles received maintenance therapy with bevacizumab 15mg/kg q 21 days for 16cycles. Based on GOG 177 which had a 6-month PFS rate of 59%, an increase in 6-month PFS to 72% with the treatment regimen was considered of clinical interest. Results. 15 patients were enrolled on protocol when accrual to the study was discontinued due to the initiation of a national randomized phase II trial. A total of 127 courses (median 8, range 1-20) of carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab combination therapy were administered. One patient suffered a bowel perforation after her first course of therapy and was inevaluable for response. Fourteen of the 15 patients (93%, 95% CI: 82-100) were progression free at 6months. The median follow-up was 36months (7-58+). The median PFS was 18months (CI: 11-25). Five complete responses and 6 partial responses were seen for an overall response rate of 73% (CI: 45-91). The median overall survival was 58months (CI: 48-68). Conclusions. The bevacizumab, paclitaxel, and carboplatin regimen is active and tolerable in advanced and recurrent EMCA.

242;25524798;The cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor palbociclib in combination with letrozole versus letrozole alone as first-line treatment of oestrogen receptor-positive, HER2-negative, advanced breast cancer (PALOMA-1/TRIO-18): a randomised phase 2 study.;"Background. Palbociclib (PD-0332991) is an oral, small-molecule inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) 4 and 6 with preclinical evidence of growth-inhibitory activity in oestrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cells and synergy with anti-oestrogens. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of palbociclib in combination with letrozole as first-line treatment of patients with advanced, oestrogen receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer. Methods. In this open-label, randomised phase 2 study, postmenopausal women with advanced oestrogen receptor-positive and HER2-negative breast cancer who had not received any systemic treatment for their advanced disease were eligible to participate. Patients were enrolled in two separate cohorts that accrued sequentially: in cohort 1, patients were enrolled on the basis of their oestrogen receptor-positive and HER2-negative biomarker status alone, whereas in cohort 2 they were also required to have cancers with amplification of cyclin D1 (CCND1), loss of p16 (INK4A or CDKN2A), or both. In both cohorts, patients were randomly assigned 1:1 via an interactive web-based randomisation system, stratified by disease site and disease-free interval, to receive continuous oral letrozole 2.5 mg daily or continuous oral letrozole 2.5 mg daily plus oral palbociclib 125 mg, given once daily for 3 weeks followed by 1 week off over 28-day cycles. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat population. Accrual to cohort 2 was stopped after an unplanned interim analysis of cohort 1 and the statistical analysis plan for the primary endpoint was amended to a combined analysis of cohorts 1 and 2 (instead of cohort 2 alone). The study is ongoing but closed to accrual; these are the results of the final analysis of progression-free survival. The study is registered with the ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00721409. Findings. Between Dec 22, 2009, and May 12, 2012, we randomly assigned 165 patients, 84 to palbociclib plus letrozole and 81 to letrozole alone. At the time of the final analysis for progression-free survival (median follow-up 29.6 months [95% CI 27.9-36.0] for the palbociclib plus letrozole group and 27.9 months [25.5-31.1] for the letrozole group), 41 progression-free survival events had occurred in the palbociclib plus letrozole group and 59 in the letrozole group. Median progression-free survival was 10.2 months (95% CI 5.7-12.6) for the letrozole group and 20.2 months (13.8-27.5) for the palbociclib plus letrozole group (HR 0.488, 95% CI 0.319-0.748; one-sided p=0.0004). In cohort 1 (n=66), median progression-free survival was 5.7 months (2.6-10.5) for the letrozole group and 26.1 months (11.2-not estimable) for the palbociclib plus letrozole group (HR 0.299, 0.156-0.572; one-sided p<0.0001); in cohort 2 (n=99), median progression-free survival was 11.1 months (7.1-16.4) for the letrozole group and 18.1 months (13.1-27.5) for the palbociclib plus letrozole group (HR 0.508, 0.303-0.853; one-sided p=0.0046). Grade 3-4 neutropenia was reported in 45 (54%) of 83 patients in the palbociclib plus letrozole group versus one (1%) of 77 patients in the letrozole group, leucopenia in 16 (19%) versus none, and fatigue in four (4%) versus one (1%). Serious adverse events that occurred in more than one patient in the palbociclib plus letrozole group were pulmonary embolism (three [4%] patients), back pain (two [2%]), and diarrhoea (two [2%]). No cases of febrile neutropenia or neutropenia-related infections were reported during the study. 11 (13%) patients in the palbociclib plus letrozole group and two (2%) in the letrozole group discontinued the study because of adverse events. Interpretation. The addition of palbociclib to letrozole in this phase 2 study significantly improved progression-free survival in women with advanced oestrogen receptor-positive and HER2-negative breast cancer.

243;25777187;96-week resistance analyses of the STaR study: rilpivirine/emtricitabine/tenofovir DF versus efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir DF in antiretroviral-naive, HIV-1-infected subjects.;"Background. STaR (GS-US-264-0110) was a 96-week phase 3b study evaluating the safety and efficacy of two single-tablet regimens, rilpivirine/emtricitabine/tenofovir DF (RPV/FTC/TDF) and efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir DF (EFV/FTC/TDF) in treatment-naive, HIV-1-infected subjects. Methods. Genotypic analyses (population sequencing) of HIV-1 protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase (RT) were performed at screening; subjects with pre-existing resistance to study drugs were excluded. The protocol-defined resistance analysis population had genotypic/phenotypic analyses at failure and baseline for PR and RT. Results. Through week 96, the resistance analysis population included 24/394 subjects (6.1%) receiving RPV/FTC/TDF and 9/392 subjects (2.3%) receiving EFV/FTC/TDF. In the RPV/FTC/TDF arm, HIV-1 isolates from 21/394 subjects (5.3%) developed non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) and/or nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) resistance mutations and 20/21 isolates had both NNRTI and NRTI genotypic and/or phenotypic resistance. In the EFV/FTC/TDF arm, isolates from 4/392 subjects (1.0%) developed NNRTI and/or NRTI resistance mutations. Resistance development after week 48 was infrequent (1.0% RPV/FTC/TDF; 0.3% EFV/FTC/TDF). When stratified by baseline HIV-1 RNA ≤ or >100 000 copies/ml, 9/260 (3.5%) versus 12/134 (9.0%) RPV/FTC/TDF-treated subjects and 3/250 (1.2%) versus 1/142 (0.7%) EFV/FTC/TDF-treated subjects developed resistant isolates, respectively. Pre-existing NRTI- and NNRTI-associated resistance mutations (not related to study drugs) did not impact treatment response to either regimen. Conclusions. Resistance development to RPV/FTC/TDF consisted of NNRTI and NRTI mutations and was more frequent than resistance development to EFV/FTC/TDF through week 96. Emergent resistance after week 48 was infrequent in both arms. Within the RPV/FTC/TDF arm, resistance development was more frequent in subjects with baseline HIV-1 RNA >100 000 copies/ml compared to baseline HIV-1 RNA ≤ 100 000 copies/ml.";Neoplasms;Interventional;Indomain;Train
244;26040499;Adjuvant denosumab in breast cancer (ABCSG-18): a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.;"Background. Adjuvant endocrine therapy compromises bone health in patients with breast cancer, causing osteopenia, osteoporosis, and fractures. Antiresorptive treatments such as bisphosphonates prevent and counteract these side-effects. In this trial, we aimed to investigate the effects of the anti-RANK ligand antibody denosumab in postmenopausal, aromatase inhibitor-treated patients with early-stage hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. Methods. In this prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, postmenopausal patients with early hormone receptor-positive breast cancer receiving treatment with aromatase inhibitors were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either denosumab 60 mg or placebo administered subcutaneously every 6 months in 58 trial centres in Austria and Sweden. Patients were assigned by an interactive voice response system. The randomisation schedule used a randomly permuted block design with block sizes 2 and 4, stratified by type of hospital regarding Hologic device for DXA scans, previous aromatase inhibitor use, and baseline bone mineral density. Patients, treating physicians, investigators, data managers, and all study personnel were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was time from randomisation to first clinical fracture, analysed by intention to treat. As an additional sensitivity analysis, we also analysed the primary endpoint on the per-protocol population. Patients were treated until the prespecified number of 247 first clinical fractures was reached. This trial is ongoing (patients are in follow-up) and is registered with the European Clinical Trials Database, number 2005-005275-15, and with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00556374. Findings. Between Dec 18, 2006, and July 22, 2013, 3425 eligible patients were enrolled into the trial, of whom 3420 were randomly assigned to receive denosumab 60 mg (n=1711) or placebo (n=1709) subcutaneously every 6 months. Compared with the placebo group, patients in the denosumab group had a significantly delayed time to first clinical fracture (hazard ratio [HR] 0·50 [95% CI 0·39-0·65], p<0·0001). The overall lower number of fractures in the denosumab group (92) than in the placebo group (176) was similar in all patient subgroups, including in patients with a bone mineral density T-score of -1 or higher at baseline (n=1872, HR 0·44 [95% CI 0·31-0·64], p<0·0001) and in those with a bone mineral density T-score of less than -1 already at baseline (n=1548, HR 0·57 [95% CI 0·40-0·82], p=0·002). The patient incidence of adverse events in the safety analysis set (all patients who received at least one dose of study drug) did not differ between the denosumab group (1366 events, 80%) and the placebo group (1334 events, 79%), nor did the numbers of serious adverse events (521 vs 511 [30% in each group]). The main adverse events were arthralgia and other aromatase-inhibitor related symptoms; no additional toxicity from the study drug was reported. Despite proactive adjudication of every potential osteonecrosis of the jaw by an international expert panel, no cases of osteonecrosis of the jaw were reported. 93 patients (3% of the full analysis set) died during the study, of which one death (in the denosumab group) was thought to be related to the study drug. Interpretation. Adjuvant denosumab 60 mg twice per year reduces the risk of clinical fractures in postmenopausal women with breast cancer receiving aromatase inhibitors, and can be administered without added toxicity. Since a main side-effect of adjuvant breast cancer treatment can be substantially reduced by the addition of denosumab, this treatment should be considered for clinical practice. Funding.

Vascular endothelial growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor signaling in the tumor microenvironment appear to cooperate in promoting tumor angiogenesis. Patients and methods. We conducted a phase I trial combining bevacizumab (i.v. every 2 weeks) and imatinib (oral daily). Once a recommended phase II dose combination was established, a phase II trial was initiated in patients with metastatic melanoma. A Simon 2-stage design was used with 23 patients required in the first stage and 41 patients in total should the criteria to proceed be met. We required that 50% of the patients be progression-free at 16 weeks. Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) and power Doppler ultrasonography were performed in patients with metastatic tumors amenable to imaging with these methods at baseline and after 4 weeks. Results. A total of 17 patients were accrued to 4 dose and combination levels. Bevacizumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks could be safely combined with imatinib 800 mg daily. Common toxicities included fatigue, nausea, vomiting, edema, proteinuria, and anemia, but were not commonly severe. A total of 23 patients with metastatic melanoma (48% with American Joint Commission on Cancer stage M1c; median age, 63 years) were enrolled in the first stage of phase II. The 16-week progression-free survival rate was 35%, leading to termination of phase II after the first stage. In the small subset of patients who remained on study with lesions evaluable by DCE-MRI, significant decreases in tumor vascular permeability were noted, despite early disease progression using the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors. Conclusion. Bevacizumab and imatinib can be safely combined at the maximum doses used for each agent.

246;26406148;Nivolumab versus Everolimus in Advanced Renal-Cell Carcinoma.;"Background. Nivolumab, a programmed death 1 (PD-1) checkpoint inhibitor, was associated with encouraging overall survival in uncontrolled studies involving previously treated patients with advanced renal-cell carcinoma. This randomized, open-label, phase 3 study compared nivolumab with everolimus in patients with renal-cell carcinoma who had received previous treatment. Methods. A total of 821 patients with advanced clear-cell renal-cell carcinoma for which they had received previous treatment with one or two regimens of antiangiogenic therapy were randomly assigned (in a 1:1 ratio) to receive 3 mg of nivolumab per kilogram of body weight intravenously every 2 weeks or a 10-mg everolimus tablet orally once daily. The primary end point was overall survival. The secondary end points included the objective response rate and safety. Results. The median overall survival was 25.0 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 21.8 to not estimable) with nivolumab and 19.6 months (95% CI, 17.6 to 23.1) with everolimus. The hazard ratio for death with nivolumab versus everolimus was 0.73 (98.5% CI, 0.57 to 0.93; P=0.002), which met the prespecified criterion for superiority (P≤0.0148). The objective response rate was greater with nivolumab than with everolimus (25% vs. 5%; odds ratio, 5.98 [95% CI, 3.68 to 9.72]; P<0.001). The median progression-free survival was 4.6 months (95% CI, 3.7 to 5.4) with nivolumab and 4.4 months (95% CI, 3.7 to 5.5) with everolimus (hazard ratio, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.75 to 1.03; P=0.11). Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 19% of the patients receiving nivolumab and in 37% of the patients receiving everolimus; the most common event with nivolumab was fatigue (in 2% of the patients), and the most common event with everolimus was anemia (in 8%). Conclusions. Among patients with previously treated advanced renal-cell carcinoma, overall survival was longer and fewer grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred with nivolumab than with everolimus.

Effective systemic therapies for patients with advanced, progressive neuroendocrine tumours of the lung or gastrointestinal tract are scarce. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of everolimus compared with placebo in this patient population. Methods. In the randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 RADIANT-4 trial, adult patients (aged ≥18 years) with advanced, progressive, well-differentiated, non-functional neuroendocrine tumours of lung or gastrointestinal origin were enrolled from 97 centres in 25 countries worldwide. Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio by an interactive voice response system to receive everolimus 10 mg per day orally or identical placebo, both with supportive care. Patients were stratified by tumour origin, performance status, and previous somatostatin analogue treatment. Patients, investigators, and the study sponsor were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival assessed by central radiology review, analysed by intention to treat. Overall survival was a key secondary endpoint. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01524783. Findings. Between April 3, 2012, and Aug 23, 2013, a total of 302 patients were enrolled, of whom 205 were allocated to everolimus 10 mg per day and 97 to placebo. Median progression-free survival was 11·0 months (95% CI 9·2-13·3) in the everolimus group and 3·9 months (3·6-7·4) in the placebo group. Everolimus was associated with a 52% reduction in the estimated risk of progression or death (hazard ratio [HR] 0·48 [95% CI 0·35-0·67], p<0·00001). Although not statistically significant, the results of the first pre-planned interim overall survival analysis indicated that everolimus might be associated with a reduction in the risk of death (HR 0·64 [95% CI 0·40-1·05], one-sided p=0·037, whereas the boundary for statistical significance was 0·0002). Grade 3 or 4 drug-related adverse events were infrequent and included stomatitis (in 18 [9%] of 202 patients in the everolimus group vs 0 of 98 in the placebo group), diarrhoea (15 [7%] vs 2 [2%]), infections (14 [7%] vs 0), anaemia (8 [4%] vs 1 [1%]), fatigue (7 [3%] vs 1 [1%]), and hyperglycaemia (7 [3%] vs 0). Interpretation. Treatment with everolimus was associated with significant improvement in progression-free survival in patients with progressive lung or gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumours. The safety findings were consistent with the known side-effect profile of everolimus. Everolimus is the first targeted agent to show robust anti-tumour activity with acceptable tolerability across a broad range of neuroendocrine tumours, including those arising from the pancreas, lung, and gastrointestinal tract.

248;26710211;SARC009: Phase 2 study of dasatinib in patients with previously treated, high-grade, advanced sarcoma.;Background. Dasatinib exhibited activity in preclinical models of sarcoma. The Sarcoma Alliance for Research through Collaboration (SARC) conducted a multicenter, phase 2 trial of dasatinib in patients with advanced sarcoma. Methods. Patients received dasatinib twice daily. The primary objective was to estimate the clinical benefit rate (CBR) (complete response or partial response within 6 months or stable disease duration of ≥6 months) with a target of ≥25%. Patients were enrolled into 1 of 7 different cohorts and assessed by imaging every 8 weeks using Choi criteria tumor response and a Bayesian hierarchical design. For each subtype, enrollment was stopped after a minimum of 9 patients were treated if there was a <1% chance the CBR was ≥25%. Results. A total of 200 patients were enrolled. Accrual was stopped early in 5 cohorts because of low CBR. The leiomyosarcoma (LMS) and undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS) cohorts fully accrued and 6 of 47 and 8 of 42 evaluable patients, respectively, exhibited clinical benefit. The probability that the CBR was ≥25% in the LMS and UPS cohorts was 0.008 and 0.10, respectively. The median progression-free survival ranged from 0.9 months in patients with rhabdomyosarcoma to 2.2 months in patients with LMS. The median overall survival was 8.6 months. The most frequent adverse events were constitutional, gastrointestinal, and respiratory, and 36% of patients required dose reduction for toxicity. Serious adverse events attributed to therapy occurred in 11% of patients. Conclusions. Dasatinib may have activity in patients with UPS but is inactive as a single agent in the other sarcoma subtypes included herein. The Bayesian design allowed for the early termination of accrual in 5 subtypes because of lack of drug activity.;Neoplasms;Interventional;Indomain;Train
249;27139057;Effect of Chemoradiotherapy vs Chemotherapy on Survival in Patients With Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer Controlled After 4 Months of Gemcitabine With or Without Erlotinib: The LAP07 Randomized Clinical Trial.;"Importance. In locally advanced pancreatic cancer, the role of chemoradiotherapy is controversial and the efficacy of erlotinib is unknown. Objectives. To assess whether chemoradiotherapy improves overall survival of patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer controlled after 4 months of gemcitabine-based induction chemotherapy and to assess the effect of erlotinib on survival. Design, setting, and participants. In LAP07, an international, open-label, phase 3 randomized trial, 449 patients were enrolled between 2008 and 2011. Follow-up ended in February 2013. Interventions. In the first randomization, 223 patients received 1000 mg/m2 weekly of gemcitabine alone and 219 patients received 1000 mg/m2 of gemcitabine plus 100 mg/d of erlotinib. In the second randomization involving patients with progression-free disease after 4 months, 136 patients received 2 months of the same chemotherapy and 133 underwent chemoradiotherapy (54 Gy plus capecitabine). Main outcomes and measures. The primary outcome was overall survival from the date of the first randomization. Secondary outcomes were the effect of erlotinib and quality assurance of radiotherapy on overall survival, progression-free survival of gemcitabine-erlotinib and erlotinib maintenance with gemcitabine alone at the second randomization, and toxic effects. Results. A total of 442 of the 449 patients (232 men; median age, 63.3 years) enrolled underwent the first randomization. Of these, 269 underwent the second randomization. Interim analysis was performed when 221 patients died (109 in the chemoradiotherapy group and 112 in the chemotherapy group), reaching the early stopping boundaries for futility. With a median follow-up of 36.7 months, the median overall survival from the date of the first randomization was not significantly different between chemotherapy at 16.5 months (95% CI, 14.5-18.5 months) and chemoradiotherapy at 15.2 months (95% CI, 13.9-17.3 months; hazard ratio [HR], 1.03; 95% CI, 0.79-1.34; P = .83). Median overall survival from the date of the first randomization for the 223 patients receiving gemcitabine was 13.6 months (95% CI, 12.3-15.3 months) and was 11.9 months (95% CI, 10.4-13.5 months) for the 219 patients receiving gemcitabine plus erlotinib (HR, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.97-1.45; P = .09; 188 deaths vs 191 deaths). Chemoradiotherapy was associated with decreased local progression (32% vs 46%, P = .03) and no increase in grade 3 to 4 toxicity, except for nausea. Conclusions and relevance. In this open-label, randomized trial involving patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer with disease controlled after 4 months of induction chemotherapy, there was no significant difference in overall survival with chemoradiotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone and there was no significant difference in overall survival with gemcitabine compared with gemcitabine plus erlotinib used as maintenance therapy.

250;27217448;Final 5-Year Study Results of DASISION: The Dasatinib Versus Imatinib Study in Treatment-Naive Chronic Myeloid Leukemia Patients Trial.;"Purpose. We report the 5-year analysis from the phase III Dasatinib Versus Imatinib Study in Treatment-Naive Chronic Myeloid Leukemia Patients (DASISION) trial, evaluating long-term efficacy and safety outcomes of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in chronic phase (CP) treated with dasatinib or imatinib. Patients and methods. Patients with newly diagnosed CML-CP were randomly assigned to receive dasatinib 100 mg once daily (n = 259) or imatinib 400 mg once daily (n = 260). Results. At the time of study closure, 61% and 63% of dasatinib- and imatinib-treated patients remained on initial therapy, respectively. Cumulative rates of major molecular response and molecular responses with a 4.0- or 4.5-log reduction in BCR-ABL1 transcripts from baseline by 5 years remained statistically significantly higher for dasatinib compared with imatinib. Rates for progression-free and overall survival at 5 years remained high and similar across treatment arms. In patients who achieved BCR-ABL1 ≤ 10% at 3 months (dasatinib, 84%; imatinib, 64%), improvements in progression-free and overall survival and lower rates of transformation to accelerated/blast phase were reported compared with patients with BCR-ABL1 greater than 10% at 3 months. Transformation to accelerated/blast phase occurred in 5% and 7% of patients in the dasatinib and imatinib arms, respectively. Fifteen dasatinib-treated and 19 imatinib-treated patients had BCR-ABL1 mutations identified at discontinuation. There were no new or unexpected adverse events identified in either treatment arm, and pleural effusion was the only drug-related, nonhematologic adverse event reported more frequently with dasatinib (28% v 0.8% with imatinib). First occurrences of pleural effusion were reported with dasatinib, with the highest incidence in year 1. Arterial ischemic events were uncommon in both treatment arms. Conclusion. These final results from the DASISION trial continue to support dasatinib 100 mg once daily as a safe and effective first-line therapy for the long-term treatment of CML-CP.";Neoplasms;Interventional;Indomain;Train
251;27406088;A phase I trial of the aurora kinase inhibitor, ENMD-2076, in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.;"ENMD-2076 is a novel, orally-active molecule that inhibits Aurora A kinase, as well as c-Kit, FLT3 and VEGFR2. A phase I study was conducted to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and toxicities of ENMD-2076 in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). Patients received escalating doses of ENMD-2076 administered orally daily [225 mg (n = 7), 375 mg (n = 6), 325 mg (n = 9), or 275 mg (n = 5)]. Twenty-seven patients were treated (26 AML; 1 CMML-2). The most common non-hematological toxicities of any grade, regardless of association with drug, were fatigue, diarrhea, dysphonia, dyspnea, hypertension, constipation, and abdominal pain. Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) consisted of grade 3 fatigue, grade 3 typhilitis, grade 3 syncope and grade 3 QTc prolongation). Of the 16 evaluable patients, one patient achieved a complete remission with incomplete count recovery (CRi), three experienced a morphologic leukemia-free state (MLFS) with a major hematologic improvement in platelets (HI-P), and 5 other patients had a reduction in marrow blast percentage (i.e. 11-65 %). The RP2D in this patient population is 225 mg orally once daily.";Neoplasms;Interventional;Indomain;Train
252;27520294;Efficacy and Biological Correlates of Response in a Phase II Study of Venetoclax Monotherapy in Patients with Acute Myelogenous Leukemia.;"We present a phase II, single-arm study evaluating 800 mg daily venetoclax, a highly selective, oral small-molecule B-cell leukemia/lymphoma-2 (BCL2) inhibitor in patients with high-risk relapsed/refractory acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or unfit for intensive chemotherapy. Responses were evaluated following revised International Working Group (IWG) criteria. The overall response rate was 19%; an additional 19% of patients demonstrated antileukemic activity not meeting IWG criteria (partial bone marrow response and incomplete hematologic recovery). Twelve (38%) patients had isocitrate dehydrogenase 1/2 mutations, of whom 4 (33%) achieved complete response or complete response with incomplete blood count recovery. Six (19%) patients had BCL2-sensitive protein index at screening, which correlated with time on study. BH3 profiling was consistent with on-target BCL2 inhibition and identified potential resistance mechanisms. Common adverse events included nausea, diarrhea and vomiting (all grades), and febrile neutropenia and hypokalemia (grade 3/4). Venetoclax demonstrated activity and acceptable tolerability in patients with AML and adverse features. Significance. Venetoclax monotherapy demonstrated clinical activity in patients with AML (relapsed/refractory or unfit for intensive chemotherapy) with a tolerable safety profile in this phase II study. Predictive markers of response consistent with BCL2 dependence were identified. Clinical and preclinical findings provide a compelling rationale to evaluate venetoclax combined with other agents in AML.

253;27621395;PANCREOX: A Randomized Phase III Study of Fluorouracil/Leucovorin With or Without Oxaliplatin for Second-Line Advanced Pancreatic Cancer in Patients Who Have Received Gemcitabine-Based Chemotherapy.;"Purpose The standard of care for second-line therapy in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer after gemcitabine-based therapy is not clearly defined. The CONKO-003 phase III study reported a survival benefit with second-line fluorouracil (FU) and oxaliplatin using the oxaliplatin, folinic acid, and FU (OFF) regimen. 1 PANCREOX was a phase III multicenter trial to evaluate the benefit of FU and oxaliplatin administered as modified FOLFOX6 (mFOLFOX6; infusional fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin) versus infusional FU/leucovorin (LV) in this setting. Patients and Methods Patients with confirmed advanced pancreatic cancer who were previously treated with gemcitabine therapy and with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2 were eligible. A total of 108 patients were randomly assigned to receive biweekly mFOLFOX6 or infusional FU/LV until progression. Progression-free survival (PFS) was the primary end point. Results Baseline patient characteristics were similar in both arms. No difference was observed in PFS (median, 3.1 months v 2.9 months; P = .99). Overall survival (OS) was inferior in patients assigned to mFOLFOX6 (median, 6.1 months v 9.9 months; P = .02). Increased toxicity was observed with the addition of oxaliplatin, with grade 3/4 adverse events occurring in 63% of patients who received mFOLFOX6 and 11% of those who received FU/LV. More patients in the mFOLFOX6 arm withdrew from study due to adverse events than in the FU/LV arm (20% v 2%), whereas the use of postprogression therapy was significantly higher in the FU/LV arm (25% v 7%; P = .015). No significant differences were observed in time to deterioration on the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 global health scale. Conclusion No benefit was observed with the addition of oxaliplatin, administered as mFOLFOX6, versus infusional FU/LV in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer previously treated with first-line gemcitabine.";Neoplasms;Interventional;Indomain;Train
254;27789775;Phase II and Biomarker Study of Cabozantinib in Metastatic Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Patients.;Currently, no targeted therapies are available for metastatic triplenegative breast cancer (mTNBC). We evaluated the safety, efficacy, and biomarkers of response to cabozantinib, a multikinase inhibitor, in patients with mTNBC. We conducted a single arm phase II and biomarker study that enrolled patients with measurable mTNBC. Patients received cabozantinib (60 mg daily) on a 3-week cycle and were restaged after 6 weeks and then every 9 weeks. The primary endpoint was objective response rate. Predefined secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), toxicity, and tissue and blood circulating cell and protein biomarkers. Of 35 patients who initiated protocol therapy, 3 (9% [95% confidence interval (CI): 2, 26]) achieved a partial response (PR). Nine patients achieved stable disease (SD) for at least 15 weeks, and thus the clinical benefit rate (PR+SD) was 34% [95% CI: 19, 52]. Median PFS was 2.0 months [95% CI: 1.3, 3.3]. The most common toxicities were fatigue, diarrhea, mucositis, and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia. There were no grade 4 toxicities, but 12 patients (34%) required dose reduction. Two patients had TNBCs with MET amplification. During cabozantinib therapy, there were significant and durable increases in plasma placental growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), VEGF-D, stromal cell-derived factor 1a, and carbonic anhydrase IX, and circulating CD3 + cells and CD8 + T lymphocytes, and decreases in plasma soluble VEGF receptor 2 and CD14+ monocytes (all p < .05). Higher baseline concentrations of soluble MET (sMET) associated with longer PFS (p = .03). In conclusion, cabozantinib showed encouraging safety and efficacy signals but did not meet the primary endpoint in pretreated mTNBC. Exploratory analyses of circulating biomarkers showed that cabozantinib induces systemic changes consistent with activation of the immune system and antiangiogenic activity, and that sMET should be further evaluated a potential biomarker of response. Implications for practice. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)-a disease with a dearth of effective therapies-often overexpress MET, which is associated with poor clinical outcomes. However, clinical studies of agents targeting MET and VEGF pathways-alone or in combination-have shown disappointing results. This study of cabozantinib (a dual VEGFR2/MET) in metastatic TNBC, while not meeting its prespecified endpoint, showed that treatment is associated with circulating biomarker changes, and is active in a subset of patients. Furthermore, this study demonstrates that cabozantinib therapy induces a systemic increase in cytotoxic lymphocyte populations and a decrease in immunosuppressive myeloid populations. This supports the testing of combinations of cabozantinib with immunotherapy in future studies in breast cancer patients.;Neoplasms;Interventional;Indomain;Test
255;27932229;Regorafenib for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who progressed on sorafenib treatment (RESORCE): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial.;"Background. There are no systemic treatments for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) whose disease progresses during sorafenib treatment. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of regorafenib in patients with HCC who have progressed during sorafenib treatment. Methods. In this randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, phase 3 trial done at 152 sites in 21 countries, adults with HCC who tolerated sorafenib (≥400 mg/day for ≥20 of last 28 days of treatment), progressed on sorafenib, and had Child-Pugh A liver function were enrolled. Participants were randomly assigned (2:1) by a computer-generated randomisation list and interactive voice response system and stratified by geographical region, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, macrovascular invasion, extrahepatic disease, and α-fetoprotein level to best supportive care plus oral regorafenib 160 mg or placebo once daily during weeks 1-3 of each 4-week cycle. Investigators, patients, and the funder were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was overall survival (defined as time from randomisation to death due to any cause) and analysed by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01774344. Findings. Between May 14, 2013, and Dec 31, 2015, 843 patients were screened, of whom 573 were enrolled and randomised (379 to regorafenib and 194 to placebo; population for efficacy analyses), and 567 initiated treatment (374 received regorafenib and 193 received placebo; population for safety analyses). Regorafenib improved overall survival with a hazard ratio of 0·63 (95% CI 0·50-0·79; one-sided p<0·0001); median survival was 10·6 months (95% CI 9·1-12·1) for regorafenib versus 7·8 months (6·3-8·8) for placebo. Adverse events were reported in all regorafenib recipients (374 [100%] of 374) and 179 (93%) of 193 placebo recipients. The most common clinically relevant grade 3 or 4 treatment-emergent events were hypertension (57 patients [15%] in the regorafenib group vs nine patients [5%] in the placebo group), hand-foot skin reaction (47 patients [13%] vs one [1%]), fatigue (34 patients [9%] vs nine patients [5%]), and diarrhoea (12 patients [3%] vs no patients). Of the 88 deaths (grade 5 adverse events) reported during the study (50 patients [13%] assigned to regorafenib and 38 [20%] assigned to placebo), seven (2%) were considered by the investigator to be related to study drug in the regorafenib group and two (1%) in the placebo group, including two patients (1%) with hepatic failure in the placebo group. Interpretation. Regorafenib is the only systemic treatment shown to provide survival benefit in HCC patients progressing on sorafenib treatment. Future trials should explore combinations of regorafenib with other systemic agents and third-line treatments for patients who fail or who do not tolerate the sequence of sorafenib and regorafenib.

LUME-Lung 2 investigated the efficacy/safety of nintedanib plus pemetrexed in patients with pretreated non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Materials and methods. Patients with stage IIIB/IV or recurrent non-squamous NSCLC who had received one prior chemotherapy regimen were randomized (1:1 stratified by histology [adenocarcinoma/non-adenocarcinoma], prior bevacizumab, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status and presence of brain metastases) to receive intravenous pemetrexed 500mg/m2 on Day 1 plus nintedanib 200mg orally twice daily or matching placebo on Days 2-21, every 3 weeks until progression/unacceptable toxicity. Progression-free survival (PFS) by independent central review was the primary endpoint. Overall survival (OS) was the key secondary endpoint. Results. Based on the pre-planned futility analysis of investigator-assessed PFS, conducted by an independent data monitoring committee, recruitment was halted on 18 June 2011 after 713 (n=353 nintedanib/pemetrexed; n=360 placebo/pemetrexed)/1300 planned patients had enrolled. There were no safety concerns. Subsequent analysis demonstrated a significant improvement in PFS favoring nintedanib/pemetrexed over placebo/pemetrexed (median 4.4 months vs 3.6 months; hazard ratio [HR]=0.83, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.70-0.99, p=0.0435). There was no significant difference in OS (median 12.0 months vs 12.7 months; HR=1.01, 95% CI 0.85-1.21, p=0.8940) after 514 deaths. Nintedanib/pemetrexed resulted in a higher incidence of grade ≥3 elevated alanine aminotransferase (23.3% vs 7.3%), elevated aspartate aminotransferase (12.1% vs 1.7%) and diarrhea (3.5% vs 1.1%) compared with placebo/pemetrexed, but no difference in hypertension, bleeding or thrombosis. Conclusion. Although recruitment stopped prematurely, combining nintedanib with pemetrexed significantly prolonged PFS in patients with advanced non-squamous NSCLC after first-line chemotherapy, with a manageable safety profile.";Neoplasms;Interventional;Indomain;Train
257;27993796;Phase I dose escalation study of the PI3kinase pathway inhibitor BKM120 and the oral poly (ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor olaparib for the treatment of high-grade serous ovarian and breast cancer.;"Background. Based upon preclinical synergy in murine models, we carried out a phase I trial to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), toxicities, pharmacokinetics, and biomarkers of response for the combination of BKM120, a PI3K inhibitor, and olaparib, a PARP inhibitor. Patients and methods. Olaparib was administered twice daily (tablet formulation) and BKM120 daily on a 28-day cycle, both orally. A 3 + 3 dose-escalation design was employed with the primary objective of defining the combination MTD, and secondary objectives were to define toxicities, activity, and pharmacokinetic profiles. Eligibility included recurrent breast (BC) or ovarian cancer (OC); dose-expansion cohorts at the MTD were enrolled for each cancer. Results. In total, 69 of 70 patients enrolled received study treatment; one patient never received study treatment because of ineligibility. Twenty-four patients had BC; 46 patients had OC. Thirty-five patients had a germline BRCA mutation (gBRCAm). Two DLTs (grade 3 transaminitis and hyperglycemia) were observed at DL0 (BKM120 60 mg/olaparib and 100 mg b.i.d.). The MTD was determined to be BKM120 50 mg q.d. and olaparib 300 mg b.i.d. (DL8). Additional DLTs included grade 3 depression and transaminitis, occurring early in cycle 2 (DL7). Anticancer activity was observed in BC and OC and in gBRCAm and gBRCA wild-type (gBRCAwt) patients. Conclusions. BKM120 and olaparib can be co-administered, but the combination requires attenuation of the BKM120 dose. Clinical benefit was observed in both gBRCAm and gBRCAwt pts. Randomized phase II studies will be needed to further define the efficacy of PI3K/PARP-inhibitor combinations as compared with a PARP inhibitor alone.";Neoplasms;Interventional;Indomain;Train

T-DM1 demonstrated encouraging efficacy and safety in a phase II study of patients with previously untreated HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. Combination T-DM1 and pertuzumab showed synergistic activity in cell culture models and had an acceptable safety profile in a phase Ib and II study. Methods In the MARIANNE study, 1,095 patients with centrally assessed, HER2-positive, advanced breast cancer and no prior therapy for advanced disease were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to control (trastuzumab plus taxane), T-DM1 plus placebo, hereafter T-DM1, or T-DM1 plus pertuzumab at standard doses. Primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS), as assessed by independent review. Results T-DM1 and T-DM1 plus pertuzumab showed noninferior PFS compared with trastuzumab plus taxane (median PFS: 13.7 months with trastuzumab plus taxane, 14.1 months with T-DM1, and 15.2 months with T-DM1 plus pertuzumab). Neither experimental arm showed PFS superiority to trastuzumab plus taxane. Response rate was 67.9% in patients who were treated with trastuzumab plus taxane, 59.7% with T-DM1, and 64.2% with T-DM1 plus pertuzumab; median response duration was 12.5 months, 20.7 months, and 21.2 months, respectively. The incidence of grade ≥ 3 adverse events was numerically higher in the control arm (54.1%) versus the T-DM1 arm (45.4%) and T-DM1 plus pertuzumab arm (46.2%). Numerically fewer patients discontinued treatment because of adverse events in the T-DM1 arms, and health-related quality of life was maintained for longer in the T-DM1 arms. Conclusion T-DM1 showed noninferior, but not superior, efficacy and better tolerability than did taxane plus trastuzumab for first-line treatment of HER2-positive, advanced breast cancer.";Neoplasms;Interventional;Indomain;Train

To conduct a phase III study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ertugliflozin monotherapy in people with type 2 diabetes. Materials and methods. This was a 52-week, double-blind, multicentre, randomized, parallel-group study with a 26-week, placebo-controlled treatment period (phase A), followed by a 26-week active-controlled treatment period (phase B) in 461 men and women, aged ≥18 years with inadequate glycaemic control (glycated haemoglobin [HbA1c] concentration 7.0% to 10.5% [53-91 mmol/mol], inclusive) despite diet and exercise. Results from phase A are reported in the present paper. The primary endpoint was the change in HbA1c from baseline to week 26. Results. At week 26, the placebo-adjusted least squares mean HbA1c changes from baseline were -0.99% and -1.16% for the ertugliflozin 5 and 15 mg doses, respectively ( P < .001 for both doses). The odds of having HbA1c <7.0% (53 mmol/mol) were significantly greater in the ertugliflozin 5 and 15 mg groups compared with the placebo group. Both doses of ertugliflozin significantly lowered fasting plasma glucose and 2-hour postprandial glucose levels and body weight. The placebo-adjusted differences in changes from baseline in systolic blood pressure were not statistically significant. A higher incidence of genital mycotic infections occurred in men and women treated with ertugliflozin compared with placebo. There was no significant difference between treatments in the proportion of participants with symptomatic hypoglycaemia or adverse events associated with urinary tract infection or hypovolaemia. Conclusions. Ertugliflozin 5 and 15 mg treatment for 26 weeks provides effective glycaemic control, reduces body weight and is generally well tolerated, when used as monotherapy.;Neoplasms;Interventional;Indomain;Train
260;28150074;A phase II study of carboplatin plus weekly paclitaxel with bevacizumab for elderly patients with non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer (NEJ016).;Background The efficacy and safety of bevacizumab in elderly patients with non-small cell lung cancer remain controversial. This study focused on both selecting fit elderly patients and overcoming interpatient variability with respect to pharmacodynamics. Methods Elderly (age: ≥70 years) patients with advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer were enrolled. Patients with uncontrolled congestive heart failure and uncontrolled diabetes were excluded. The treatment regimen comprised carboplatin at an area under the curve of 5 mg/ml/min on day 1, paclitaxel at 90 mg/m on days 1 and 8, and bevacizumab at 15 mg/kg on day 1 every 21 days for up to 4 cycles, followed by maintenance bevacizumab. Dose reduction due to side effects was performed, with a wide range of doses of paclitaxel from 23 mg/m/week to 60 mg/m/week. Results Of the 36 patients entered, 38.9% required a dose reduction or cancellation of paclitaxel administration on day 8, and 75% patients were able to complete 4 cycles of triplet therapy. The response rate, primary endpoint, was 69.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 51.9-83.7). The median progression free survival and overall survival were 8.4 months and 29.2 months, respectively. The most common adverse events included neutropenia, hypertension, anemia, and infection. Although Grade ≥ 3 adverse events were observed in 24 patients (66.7%), there were no deaths due to toxicity.

261;28385537;Phase I Trial of Everolimus and Capecitabine in Metastatic HER2- Breast Cancer.;Background. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is a driver of breast tumorigenesis. The mTOR inhibitor everolimus reverses antihormonal therapy resistance and is an approved therapy for metastatic breast cancer. A synergistic effect with fluoropyrimidine has been suggested. The present study evaluated the safety and tolerability of an all-oral combination of everolimus and capecitabine for metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Patients and methods. MBC patients naive to capecitabine and mTOR inhibitors who had received ≤ 3 previous chemotherapy regimens in the metastatic setting were eligible for the present study. The patients were scheduled to receive capecitabine 825 mg/m2 twice daily for 14 days in a 21-day cycle, combined with everolimus in 5 separate dose cohorts: 2.5 mg every other day, 2.5 mg daily, 5 mg daily, 7.5 mg daily, and 10 mg daily. A 3+3 design was used. The maximum tolerated dose was based on the dose-limiting toxicity of everolimus plus capecitabine. Results. A total of 18 patients were enrolled in the present trial. The median age was 58 years. Most had received previous anthracycline (83%) and taxane (94%) therapy. The maximum tolerated dose was everolimus 7.5 mg daily and capecitabine 825 mg/m2. The incidence of grade 3 events was low and mainly hematologic in nature. One incident each of grade 4 neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, hyperglycemia, and mucositis occurred. No grade 5 events occurred. The clinical benefit rate was 50%. The median progression-free survival was 196 days, and the median overall survival was 569 days. Conclusion. The all-oral regimen of everolimus with capecitabine is active and well tolerated, with encouraging results for progression-free survival, overall survival, and clinical benefit rate in patients with MBC.;Neoplasms;Interventional;Indomain;Train
262;28439108;Phase I trial of systemic administration of Edmonston strain of measles virus genetically engineered to express the sodium iodide symporter in patients with recurrent or refractory multiple myeloma.;"MV-NIS is an Edmonston lineage oncolytic measles virus expressing the human sodium iodide symporter-a means for monitoring by non-invasive imaging of radioiodine. Patients with relapsed, refractory myeloma who had explored all other treatment options were eligible for this Phase I trial. Cohort 1 was treated with intravenous MV-NIS, and Cohort 2 received cyclophosphamide 2 days prior to MV-NIS. Thirty-two patients were treated. Cohort 1 initially enrolled to four dose levels without reaching maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and subsequently to two higher dose levels when improved virus manufacture technology made it possible. MTD was not reached in Cohort 1, and TCID50 1011 is the dose being used in a Phase II trial of single agent MV-NIS. Grade 3-4 adverse events in both cohorts at all dose levels were: neutropenia (n=9); leukocyte count decreased (n=5); thrombocytopenia (n=2); and CD4 lymphocytes decreased, anemia and lymphopenia (each n=1). MV-N RNA sequences were amplified from gargle specimens, blood and urine. 123I scans were positive in eight patients. One patient achieved a complete response; transient drops in serum free light chains were seen in other patients. MV-NIS is capable of replicating before being cleared by the immune system.

263;28564564;Adjuvant Capecitabine for Breast Cancer after Preoperative Chemotherapy.;"Background. Patients who have residual invasive carcinoma after the receipt of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer have poor prognoses. The benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy in these patients remains unclear. Methods. We randomly assigned 910 patients with HER2-negative residual invasive breast cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (containing anthracycline, taxane, or both) to receive standard postsurgical treatment either with capecitabine or without (control). The primary end point was disease-free survival. Secondary end points included overall survival. Results. The result of the prespecified interim analysis met the primary end point, so this trial was terminated early. The final analysis showed that disease-free survival was longer in the capecitabine group than in the control group (74.1% vs. 67.6% of the patients were alive and free from recurrence or second cancer at 5 years; hazard ratio for recurrence, second cancer, or death, 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.53 to 0.92; P=0.01). Overall survival was longer in the capecitabine group than in the control group (89.2% vs. 83.6% of the patients were alive at 5 years; hazard ratio for death, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.39 to 0.90; P=0.01). Among patients with triple-negative disease, the rate of disease-free survival was 69.8% in the capecitabine group versus 56.1% in the control group (hazard ratio for recurrence, second cancer, or death, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.39 to 0.87), and the overall survival rate was 78.8% versus 70.3% (hazard ratio for death, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.30 to 0.90). The hand-foot syndrome, the most common adverse reaction to capecitabine, occurred in 73.4% of the patients in the capecitabine group. Conclusions. After standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy containing anthracycline, taxane, or both, the addition of adjuvant capecitabine therapy was safe and effective in prolonging disease-free survival and overall survival among patients with HER2-negative breast cancer who had residual invasive disease on pathological testing.

264;28578601;Olaparib for Metastatic Breast Cancer in Patients with a Germline BRCA Mutation.;"Background. Olaparib is an oral poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase inhibitor that has promising antitumor activity in patients with metastatic breast cancer and a germline BRCA mutation. Methods. We conducted a randomized, open-label, phase 3 trial in which olaparib monotherapy was compared with standard therapy in patients with a germline BRCA mutation and human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2)-negative metastatic breast cancer who had received no more than two previous chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease. Patients were randomly assigned, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive olaparib tablets (300 mg twice daily) or standard therapy with single-agent chemotherapy of the physician's choice (capecitabine, eribulin, or vinorelbine in 21-day cycles). The primary end point was progression-free survival, which was assessed by blinded independent central review and was analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. Results. Of the 302 patients who underwent randomization, 205 were assigned to receive olaparib and 97 were assigned to receive standard therapy. Median progression-free survival was significantly longer in the olaparib group than in the standard-therapy group (7.0 months vs. 4.2 months; hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.58; 95% confidence interval, 0.43 to 0.80; P<0.001). The response rate was 59.9% in the olaparib group and 28.8% in the standard-therapy group. The rate of grade 3 or higher adverse events was 36.6% in the olaparib group and 50.5% in the standard-therapy group, and the rate of treatment discontinuation due to toxic effects was 4.9% and 7.7%, respectively. Conclusions. Among patients with HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer and a germline BRCA mutation, olaparib monotherapy provided a significant benefit over standard therapy; median progression-free survival was 2.8 months longer and the risk of disease progression or death was 42% lower with olaparib monotherapy than with standard therapy.

265;28609226;Phase II Trial of Atezolizumab As First-Line or Subsequent Therapy for Patients With Programmed Death-Ligand 1-Selected Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (BIRCH).;"Purpose BIRCH was designed to examine the efficacy of atezolizumab, a humanized anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) monoclonal antibody, in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) across lines of therapy. Patients were selected on the basis of PD-L1 expression on tumor cells (TC) or tumor-infiltrating immune cells (IC). Patients and Methods Eligible patients had advanced-stage NSCLC, no CNS metastases, and zero to two or more lines of prior chemotherapy. Patients whose tumors expressed PD-L1 using the SP142 immunohistochemistry assay on ≥ 5% of TC or IC (TC2/3 or IC2/3 [TC or IC ≥ 5% PD-L1-expressing cells, respectively]) were enrolled. Atezolizumab 1,200 mg was administered intravenously every 3 weeks. Efficacy-evaluable patients (N = 659) comprised three cohorts: first line (cohort 1; n = 139); second line (cohort 2; n = 268); and third line or higher (cohort 3; n = 252). The primary end point was independent review facility-assessed objective response rate (ORR; Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] version 1.1). Secondary end points included median duration of response, progression-free survival, and overall survival (OS). Results BIRCH met its primary objective of demonstrating a significant ORR versus historical controls. With a minimum of 12 months of follow-up, the independent review facility-assessed ORR was 18% to 22% for the three cohorts, and 26% to 31% for the TC3 or IC3 subgroup; most responses are ongoing. Responses occurred regardless of EGFR or KRAS mutation status. The median OS from an updated survival analysis (minimum of 20 month follow up) for cohort 1 was 23.5 months (26.9 months for TC3 or IC3 patients); the median OS in cohorts 2 and 3 was 15.5 and 13.2 months, respectively. The safety profile was similar across cohorts and consistent with previous atezolizumab monotherapy trials. Conclusion BIRCH demonstrated responses with atezolizumab monotherapy in patients with PD-L1-selected advanced NSCLC, with good tolerability. PD-L1 status may serve as a predictive biomarker for identifying patients most likely to benefit from atezolizumab.";Neoplasms;Interventional;Indomain;Train
266;28632865;Effect of First-Line Chemotherapy Combined With Cetuximab or Bevacizumab on Overall Survival in Patients With KRAS Wild-Type Advanced or Metastatic Colorectal Cancer: A Randomized Clinical Trial.;"Importance. Combining biologic monoclonal antibodies with chemotherapeutic cytotoxic drugs provides clinical benefit to patients with advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer, but the optimal choice of the initial biologic therapy in previously untreated patients is unknown. Objective. To determine if the addition of cetuximab vs bevacizumab to the combination of leucovorin, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin (mFOLFOX6) regimen or the combination of leucovorin, fluorouracil, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) regimen is superior as first-line therapy in advanced or metastatic KRAS wild-type (wt) colorectal cancer. Design, setting, and participants. Patients (≥18 years) enrolled at community and academic centers throughout the National Clinical Trials Network in the United States and Canada (November 2005-March 2012) with previously untreated advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer whose tumors were KRAS wt chose to take either the mFOLFOX6 regimen or the FOLFIRI regimen as chemotherapy and were randomized to receive either cetuximab (n = 578) or bevacizumab (n = 559). The last date of follow-up was December 15, 2015. Interventions. Cetuximab vs bevacizumab combined with either mFOLFOX6 or FOLFIRI chemotherapy regimen chosen by the treating physician and patient. Main outcomes and measures. The primary end point was overall survival. Secondary objectives included progression-free survival and overall response rate, site-reported confirmed or unconfirmed complete or partial response. Results. Among 1137 patients (median age, 59 years; 440 [39%] women), 1074 (94%) of patients met eligibility criteria. As of December 15, 2015, median follow-up for 263 surviving patients was 47.4 months (range, 0-110.7 months), and 82% of patients (938 of 1137) experienced disease progression. The median overall survival was 30.0 months in the cetuximab-chemotherapy group and 29.0 months in the bevacizumab-chemotherapy group with a stratified hazard ratio (HR) of 0.88 (95% CI, 0.77-1.01; P = .08). The median progression-free survival was 10.5 months in the cetuximab-chemotherapy group and 10.6 months in the bevacizumab-chemotherapy group with a stratified HR of 0.95 (95% CI, 0.84-1.08; P = .45). Response rates were not significantly different, 59.6% vs 55.2% for cetuximab and bevacizumab, respectively (difference, 4.4%, 95% CI, 1.0%-9.0%, P = .13). Conclusions and relevance. Among patients with KRAS wt untreated advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer, there was no significant difference in overall survival between the addition of cetuximab vs bevacizumab to chemotherapy as initial biologic treatment.

267;28753384;Cabazitaxel Versus Docetaxel As First-Line Therapy for Patients With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Randomized Phase III Trial-FIRSTANA.;"Purpose In patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), overall survival (OS) is significantly improved with cabazitaxel versus mitoxantrone after prior docetaxel treatment. FIRSTANA ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01308567) assessed whether cabazitaxel 20 mg/m2 (C20) or 25 mg/m2 (C25) is superior to docetaxel 75 mg/m2 (D75) in terms of OS in patients with chemotherapy-naive mCRPC. Patients and Methods Patients with mCRPC and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 2 were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to receive C20, C25, or D75 intravenously every 3 weeks plus daily prednisone. The primary end point was OS. Secondary end points included safety; progression-free survival (PFS); tumor, prostate-specific antigen, and pain response; pharmacokinetics; and health-related quality of life. Results Between May 2011 and April 2013, 1,168 patients were randomly assigned. Baseline characteristics were similar across cohorts. Median OS was 24.5 months with C20, 25.2 months with C25, and 24.3 months with D75. Hazard ratio for C20 versus D75 was 1.01 (95% CI, 0.85 to 1.20; P = .997), and hazard ratio for C25 versus D75 was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.82 to 1.16; P = .757). Median PFS was 4.4 months with C20, 5.1 months with C25, and 5.3 months with D75, with no significant differences between treatment arms. Radiographic tumor responses were numerically higher for C25 (41.6%) versus D75 (30.9%; nominal P = .037, without multiplicity test adjustment). Rates of grade 3 or 4 treatment-emergent adverse events were 41.2%, 60.1%, and 46.0% for C20, C25, and D75, respectively. Febrile neutropenia, diarrhea, and hematuria were more frequent with C25; peripheral neuropathy, peripheral edema, alopecia, and nail disorders were more frequent with D75. Conclusion C20 and C25 did not demonstrate superiority for OS versus D75 in patients with chemotherapy-naive mCRPC. Tumor response was numerically higher with C25 versus D75; pain PFS was numerically improved with D75 versus C25. Cabazitaxel and docetaxel demonstrated different toxicity profiles, with overall less toxicity with C20.";Neoplasms;Interventional;Indomain;Train
268;28756902;Bevacizumab for advanced cervical cancer: final overall survival and adverse event analysis of a randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 3 trial (Gynecologic Oncology Group 240).;"Background. On Aug 14, 2014, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the antiangiogenesis drug bevacizumab for women with advanced cervical cancer on the basis of improved overall survival (OS) after the second interim analysis (in 2012) of 271 deaths in the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) 240 trial. In this study, we report the prespecified final analysis of the primary objectives, OS and adverse events. Methods. In this randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 3 trial, we recruited patients with metastatic, persistent, or recurrent cervical carcinoma from 81 centres in the USA, Canada, and Spain. Inclusion criteria included a GOG performance status score of 0 or 1; adequate renal, hepatic, and bone marrow function; adequately anticoagulated thromboembolism; a urine protein to creatinine ratio of less than 1; and measurable disease. Patients who had received chemotherapy for recurrence and those with non-healing wounds or active bleeding conditions were ineligible. We randomly allocated patients 1:1:1:1 (blocking used; block size of four) to intravenous chemotherapy of either cisplatin (50 mg/m2 on day 1 or 2) plus paclitaxel (135 mg/m2 or 175 mg/m2 on day 1) or topotecan (0·75 mg/m2 on days 1-3) plus paclitaxel (175 mg/m2 on day 1) with or without intravenous bevacizumab (15 mg/kg on day 1) in 21 day cycles until disease progression, unacceptable toxic effects, voluntary withdrawal by the patient, or complete response. We stratified randomisation by GOG performance status (0 vs 1), previous radiosensitising platinum-based chemotherapy, and disease status (recurrent or persistent vs metastatic). We gave treatment open label. Primary outcomes were OS (analysed in the intention-to-treat population) and adverse events (analysed in all patients who received treatment and submitted adverse event information), assessed at the second interim and final analysis by the masked Data and Safety Monitoring Board. The cutoff for final analysis was 450 patients with 346 deaths. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00803062. Findings. Between April 6, 2009, and Jan 3, 2012, we enrolled 452 patients (225 [50%] in the two chemotherapy-alone groups and 227 [50%] in the two chemotherapy plus bevacizumab groups). By March 7, 2014, 348 deaths had occurred, meeting the prespecified cutoff for final analysis. The chemotherapy plus bevacizumab groups continued to show significant improvement in OS compared with the chemotherapy-alone groups: 16·8 months in the chemotherapy plus bevacizumab groups versus 13·3 months in the chemotherapy-alone groups (hazard ratio 0·77 [95% CI 0·62-0·95]; p=0·007). Final OS among patients not receiving previous pelvic radiotherapy was 24·5 months versus 16·8 months (0·64 [0·37-1·10]; p=0·11). Postprogression OS was not significantly different between the chemotherapy plus bevacizumab groups (8·4 months) and chemotherapy-alone groups (7·1 months; 0·83 [0·66-1·05]; p=0·06). Fistula (any grade) occurred in 32 (15%) of 220 patients in the chemotherapy plus bevacizumab groups (all previously irradiated) versus three (1%) of 220 in the chemotherapy-alone groups (all previously irradiated). Grade 3 fistula developed in 13 (6%) versus one (<1%). No fistulas resulted in surgical emergencies, sepsis, or death. Interpretation. The benefit conferred by incorporation of bevacizumab is sustained with extended follow-up as evidenced by the overall survival curves remaining separated. After progression while receiving bevacizumab, we did not observe a negative rebound effect (ie, shorter survival after bevacizumab is stopped than after chemotherapy alone is stopped). These findings represent proof-of-concept of the efficacy and tolerability of antiangiogenesis therapy in advanced cervical cancer. Funding.

269;28967485;First-line pembrolizumab in cisplatin-ineligible patients with locally advanced and unresectable or metastatic urothelial cancer (KEYNOTE-052): a multicentre, single-arm, phase 2 study.;"Background. More than half of all patients with advanced urothelial cancer cannot receive standard, first-line cisplatin-based chemotherapy because of renal dysfunction, poor performance status, or other comorbidities. We assessed the activity and safety of first-line pembrolizumab in cisplatin-ineligible patients with locally advanced and unresectable or metastatic urothelial cancer. Methods. In this multicentre, single-arm, phase 2 study (KEYNOTE-052), cisplatin-ineligible patients with advanced urothelial cancer who had not been previously treated with systemic chemotherapy were recruited from 91 academic medical centres in 20 countries. Enrolled patients received intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks. The primary endpoint was objective response (the proportion of patients who achieved complete or partial response) in all patients and by PD-L1 expression status according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1, as assessed by independent central review. PD-L1 expression was assessed in tumour and inflammatory cells from tumour biopsies provided at study entry. Activity and safety were analysed in all patients who received at least one dose of pembrolizumab (all-patients-treated population). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02335424, and follow-up is ongoing. Findings. Between Feb 24, 2015, and Aug 8, 2016, 374 patients were enrolled and 370 patients received at least one dose of pembrolizumab. 89 (24%, 95% CI 20-29) of 370 patients had a centrally assessed objective response, and as of Sept 1, 2016 (data cutoff), 74 (83%) of 89 responses were ongoing. Median follow-up was 5 months (IQR 3·0-8·6). A PD-L1-expression cutoff of 10% was associated with a higher frequency of response to pembrolizumab; 42 (38%, 95% CI 29-48) of 110 patients with a combined positive score of 10% or more had a centrally assessed objective response. The most common grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events were fatigue (eight [2%] of 370 patients), alkaline phosphatase increase (five [1%]), colitis, and muscle weakness (both four [1%]). 36 (10%) of 370 patients had a serious treatment-related adverse event. 17 (5%) of 370 patients died from non-treatment-related adverse events associated with death, and one patient died from treatment-related adverse events (myositis in addition to grade 3 thyroiditis, grade 3 hepatitis, grade 3 pneumonia, and grade 4 myocarditis). Interpretation. First-line pembrolizumab has antitumour activity and acceptable tolerability in cisplatin-ineligible patients with urothelial cancer, most of whom were elderly, had poor prognostic factors, or had serious comorbidities. In view of this result, pembrolizumab has become a new treatment option for patients who are cisplatin-ineligible or not suitable candidates for chemotherapy.

Patients with MDS/MPNs initially received ruxolitinib BID (doses based on platelets count), continuously in 28-day cycles for the first 3 cycles. Azacytidine 25 mg/m2 (Day 1-5) intravenously or subcutaneously was recommended to be added to each cycle starting cycle 4 and could be increased to 75 mg/m2 (Days 1-5) for disease control. Azacytidine could be started earlier than cycle 4 and/or at higher dose in patients with rapidly proliferative disease or with elevated blasts. Thirty-five patients were treated (MDS/MPN-U, n =14; CMML, n =17; aCML, n =4), with a median follow-up of 15.2 months (range, 1.0-41.5). All patients were evaluable by the 2015 international consortium proposal of response criteria for MDS/MPNs (ICP MDS/MPN) and 20 (57%) responded.

Osimertinib is an oral, third-generation, irreversible epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) that selectively inhibits both EGFR-TKI-sensitizing and EGFR T790M resistance mutations. We compared osimertinib with standard EGFR-TKIs in patients with previously untreated, EGFR mutation-positive advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Methods. In this double-blind, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 556 patients with previously untreated, EGFR mutation-positive (exon 19 deletion or L858R) advanced NSCLC in a 1:1 ratio to receive either osimertinib (at a dose of 80 mg once daily) or a standard EGFR-TKI (gefitinib at a dose of 250 mg once daily or erlotinib at a dose of 150 mg once daily). The primary end point was investigator-assessed progression-free survival. Results. The median progression-free survival was significantly longer with osimertinib than with standard EGFR-TKIs (18.9 months vs. 10.2 months; hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.46; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.37 to 0.57; P<0.001). The objective response rate was similar in the two groups: 80% with osimertinib and 76% with standard EGFR-TKIs (odds ratio, 1.27; 95% CI, 0.85 to 1.90; P=0.24). The median duration of response was 17.2 months (95% CI, 13.8 to 22.0) with osimertinib versus 8.5 months (95% CI, 7.3 to 9.8) with standard EGFR-TKIs. Data on overall survival were immature at the interim analysis (25% maturity). The survival rate at 18 months was 83% (95% CI, 78 to 87) with osimertinib and 71% (95% CI, 65 to 76) with standard EGFR-TKIs (hazard ratio for death, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.88; P=0.007 [nonsignificant in the interim analysis]). Adverse events of grade 3 or higher were less frequent with osimertinib than with standard EGFR-TKIs (34% vs. 45%). Conclusions. Osimertinib showed efficacy superior to that of standard EGFR-TKIs in the first-line treatment of EGFR mutation-positive advanced NSCLC, with a similar safety profile and lower rates of serious adverse events.

Cisplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy is the standard of care for patients with resected stage II-IIIA non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). RADIANT and SELECT trial data suggest patients with EGFR-mutant stage IB-IIIA resected NSCLC could benefit from adjuvant EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment. We aimed to compare the efficacy of adjuvant gefitinib versus vinorelbine plus cisplatin in patients with completely resected EGFR-mutant stage II-IIIA (N1-N2) NSCLC. Methods. We did a randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial at 27 centres in China. We enrolled patients aged 18-75 years with completely resected (R0), stage II-IIIA (N1-N2), EGFR-mutant (exon 19 deletion or exon 21 Leu858Arg) NSCLC. Patients were stratified by N stage and EGFR mutation status and randomised (1:1) by Pocock and Simon minimisation with a random element to either gefitinib (250 mg once daily) for 24 months or intravenous vinorelbine (25 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8) plus intravenous cisplatin (75 mg/m2 on day 1) every 3 weeks for four cycles.

Median disease-free survival was significantly longer with gefitinib (28·7 months [95% CI 24·9-32·5]) than with vinorelbine plus cisplatin (18·0 months [13·6-22·3]; hazard ratio [HR] 0·60, 95% CI 0·42-0·87; p=0·0054). In the safety population, the most commonly reported grade 3 or worse adverse events in the gefitinib group (n=106) were raised alanine aminotransferase and asparate aminotransferase (two [2%] patients with each event vs none with vinorelbine plus cisplatin). In the vinorelbine plus cisplatin group (n=87), the most frequently reported grade 3 or worse adverse events were neutropenia (30 [34%] patients vs none with gefitinib), leucopenia (14 [16%] vs none), and vomiting (eight [9%] vs none). Serious adverse events were reported for seven (7%) patients who received gefitinib and 20 (23%) patients who received vinorelbine plus cisplatin. No interstitial lung disease was noted with gefitinib. No deaths were treatment related. Interpretation. Adjuvant gefitinib led to significantly longer disease-free survival compared with that for vinorelbine plus cisplatin in patients with completely resected stage II-IIIA (N1-N2) EGFR-mutant NSCLC. Based on the superior disease-free survival, reduced toxicity, and improved quality of life, adjuvant gefitinib could be a potential treatment option compared with adjuvant chemotherapy in these patients. However, the duration of benefit with gefitinib after 24 months might be limited and overall survival data are not yet mature. Funding.

273;29346040;Bevacizumab Maintenance Versus No Maintenance During Chemotherapy-Free Intervals in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer: A Randomized Phase III Trial (PRODIGE 9).;"Purpose Conflicting results are reported for maintenance treatment with bevacizumab during chemotherapy-free intervals (CFI) in metastatic colorectal cancer after induction chemotherapy. Patients and Methods In this open-label, phase III, randomized controlled trial, we compared the tumor control duration (TCD) observed with bevacizumab maintenance and with no treatment (observation) during CFI subsequent to induction chemotherapy with 12 cycles of fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan plus bevacizumab. After disease progression, the induction regimen was repeated for eight cycles, followed by a new CFI. Results From March 2010 to July 2013, 491 patients were randomly assigned. Disease progression or death occurred during induction chemotherapy in 85 patients (17%); 261 patients (53%) had at least one reinduction, 107 (22%) had two reinductions, and 56 (11%) had three or more reinductions. The median TCD was 15 months in both groups; the median progression-free survival (PFS) from randomization was 9.2 and 8.9 months in the maintenance group and observation groups, respectively. The TCD observed in both groups was higher compared with the TCD hypotheses of the trial. The median overall survival (OS) was 21.7 and 22.0 months in the maintenance and observation groups, respectively. In the per-protocol population, defined as patients with at least one reinduction after the first progression, the median duration of the first CFI was 4.3 months in both arms; the median TCD was 17.8 and 23.3 months ( P = .339), the median PFS was 9.9 and 9.5 months, and the median OS was 27.6 and 28.5 months in the maintenance and observation groups, respectively. Multivariable analysis revealed that female gender, WHO performance status ≥ 2, and unresected primary tumors were associated with a shorter TCD. Conclusion Bevacizumab maintenance monotherapy did not improve TCD, CFI duration, PFS, or OS.";Neoplasms;Interventional;Indomain;Train
274;29506310;First Line Sorafenib Treatment for Metastatic Medullary Thyroid Cancer: Efficacy and Safety Analysis.;Background. Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) is a rare disease, the prognosis of advanced and metastatic disease is poor and few therapeutic options are available in this setting. Based on the results of phase II and III studies with sorafenib in differentiated thyroid cancer and the lack of availability of registered tyrosine kinase inhibitors, vandetabin and cabozantinib in Hungary, we designed a uncontrolled, prospective efficacy and safety study of patients with metastatic MTC treated with first-line sorafenib in five Hungarian oncology centers. Methods. Ten consecutive patients with progressive or symptomatic metastatic MTC were included and started sorafenib 400 mg twice a day between June 2012 and March 2016. The primary end point was median progression-free survival (mPFS). Secondary endpoints included disease control rate, biochemical response, symptomatic response and toxicity. Results. Four patients achieved partial remission (40%) according to RECIST 1.1 evaluation. Five patients had stable disease beyond 12 months (50%) and one patient had progressive disease (10%). Median PFS was 19.1 months. The disease control rate was 90%. Association between radiologic response and biochemical or symptomatic response was inconsistent. Most common side effects were Grade 1-2 fatigue (60%), palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, rash/dermatitis 50-50%, alopecia 40%. Conclusions. In our prospective case series in patients with MTC first-line sorafenib showed at least similar efficacy as in other small phase II trials and case reports. Based on comparable efficacy with registered tyrosine kinase inhibitors and it's manageable toxicity profile, we believe that sorafenib has role in the sequential treatment of MTC.;Neoplasms;Interventional;Indomain;Train
275;29656442;Treatment-emergent hypertension and efficacy in the phase 3 Study of (E7080) lenvatinib in differentiated cancer of the thyroid (SELECT).;"Background. Hypertension (HTN) is an established class effect of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) inhibition. In the phase 3 Study of (E7080) Lenvatinib in Differentiated Cancer of the Thyroid (SELECT) trial, HTN was the most frequent adverse event of lenvatinib, an inhibitor of VEGFR1, VEGFR2, VEGFR3, fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1), FGFR2, FGFR3, FGFR4, platelet-derived growth factor receptor α (PDGFRα), ret proto-oncogene (RET), and stem cell factor receptor (KIT). This exploratory analysis examined treatment-emergent hypertension (TE-HTN) and its relation with lenvatinib efficacy and safety in SELECT. Methods. In the multicenter, double-blind SELECT trial, 392 patients with progressive radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (RR-DTC) were randomized 2:1 to lenvatinib (24 mg/d on a 28-day cycle) or placebo. Survival endpoints were assessed with Kaplan-Meier estimates and log-rank tests. The influence of TE-HTN on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) was analyzed with univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models. Results. Overall, 73% of lenvatinib-treated patients and 15% of placebo-treated patients experienced TE-HTN. The median PFS for lenvatinib-treated patients with (n = 190) and without TE-HTN (n = 71) was 18.8 and 12.9 months, respectively (hazard ratio [HR], 0.59; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.39-0.88; P = .0085). For lenvatinib-treated patients, the objective response rate was 69% with TE-HTN and 56% without TE-HTN (odds ratio, 1.72; 95% CI, 0.98-3.01). The median change in tumor size for patients with and without TE-HTN was -45% and -40%, respectively (P = .2). The median OS was not reached for patients with TE-HTN; for those without TE-HTN, it was 21.7 months (HR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.27-0.69; P = .0003). Conclusions. Although HTN is a clinically significant adverse event that warrants monitoring and management, TE-HTN was significantly correlated with improved outcomes in patients with RR-DTC, indicating that HTN may be predictive for lenvatinib efficacy in this population.

276;29880231;Pembrolizumab versus paclitaxel for previously treated, advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer (KEYNOTE-061): a randomised, open-label, controlled, phase 3 trial.;"Background. Patients with advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer that progresses on chemotherapy have poor outcomes. We compared pembrolizumab with paclitaxel in patients with advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer that progressed on first-line chemotherapy with a platinum and fluoropyrimidine. Methods. This randomised, open-label, phase 3 study was done at 148 medical centres in 30 countries. Eligible patients were randomised (1:1) in blocks of four per stratum with an interactive voice-response and integrated web-response system to receive either pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks for up to 2 years or standard-dose paclitaxel. Primary endpoints were overall survival and progression-free survival in patients with a programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) combined positive score (CPS) of 1 or higher. Safety was assessed in all patients, irrespective of CPS. The significance threshold for overall survival was p=0·0135 (one-sided). This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02370498. Findings. Between June 4, 2015, and July 26, 2016, 592 patients were enrolled. Of the 395 patients who had a PD-L1 CPS of 1 or higher, 196 patients were assigned to receive pembrolizumab and 199 patients were assigned to receive paclitaxel. As of Oct 26, 2017, 326 patients in the population with CPS of 1 or higher had died (151 [77%] of 196 patients in the pembrolizumab group and 175 [88%] of 199 patients in the paclitaxel group). Median overall survival was 9·1 months (95% CI 6·2-10·7) with pembrolizumab and 8·3 months (7·6-9·0) with paclitaxel (hazard ratio [HR] 0·82, 95% CI 0·66-1·03; one-sided p=0·0421). Median progression-free survival was 1·5 months (95% CI 1·4-2·0) with pembrolizumab and 4·1 months (3·1-4·2) with paclitaxel (HR 1·27, 95% CI 1·03-1·57). In the total population, grade 3-5 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 42 (14%) of the 294 patients treated with pembrolizumab and 96 (35%) of the 276 patients treated with paclitaxel. Interpretation. Pembrolizumab did not significantly improve overall survival compared with paclitaxel as second-line therapy for advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer with PD-L1 CPS of 1 or higher. Pembrolizumab had a better safety profile than paclitaxel. Additional trials of pembrolizumab in gastric and gastro-oesophageal cancer are ongoing. Funding.

277;30194205;Tumor Size-driven Dose of Intraoperative Radiotherapy for Breast Cancer: 18 Gy Versus 21 Gy.;Aim. To test whether a reduced total single dose of 18 Gy of intraoperative radiotherapy with electrons (IORT) may be tailored to safely treat patients in comparison with the standard dose of 21 Gy. (NCT01276938). Patients and methods. From October 2009 to December 2011, 199 females affected by breast cancer were treated with conservative surgery and IORT with two different exclusive doses, 18 or 21 Gy. Results. The median follow-up was 91 months (16-104 months). Sixty-five patients (pT1a\b, pN0\mic, pMx, G1-G3) received 18 Gy and 134 patients (pT1c\2, pN0\mic, pMx, G1-G3) received 21 Gy. No significant difference in local recurrence-free survival or overall survival was detected in the 18 Gy-treated arm versus that treated with 21 Gy: 96.9% vs. 96.3%, p=0.72, and 96.9% vs. 95.5%, p=0.82, respectively at 5 years.

278;30245189;Phase I study of ruxolitinib in previously treated patients with low or intermediate-1 risk myelodysplastic syndrome with evidence of NF-kB activation.;Therapeutic options for patients with lower-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who have failed prior therapies are limited particularly after hypomethylating agent. Several studies have indicated that deregulation of innate immunity signaling is critical in the pathogenesis of MDS. This process involves Toll-like receptor stimulation, cytokine overexpression, and nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) activation. Since ruxolitinib, a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, suppresses NF-kB expression, we conducted a phase 1 dose-escalation study to determine the safety and efficacy of ruxolitinib in previously treated lower-risk MDS patients with evidence of NF-kB activation. Nineteen patients, 8 with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and 11 with MDS, were enrolled. No dose limiting toxicity was observed and the maximum tolerated dose was 20 mg twice daily. Responses were restricted to MDS patients with an overall response rate of 22% [hematological improvement in platelets (HI-P) = 2, hematological improvement in erythrocytes (HI-E) = 1, partial cytogenetic response (PCyR) = 1]. Of these patients, 2 relapsed (HI-P and PCyR) and 2 continue to be in HI-P and HI-E, respectively, with ongoing therapy. Meaningful improvement in bone marrow dysplasia was only seen in a patient who achieved HI-E. Phosphorylated p65 (pp65) decreased in 6 of 15 patients (40%) including the 2 patients with continued response to treatment and increased in a patient who relapsed after a short-lived HI-P. This suggests potential correlation between reduction in pp65 expression and response duration. In conclusion, ruxolitinib was well-tolerated in previously treated lower-risk MDS patients with evidence of NF-kB activation and resulted in low but significant frequency of responses.

279;30280635;Pembrolizumab plus Chemotherapy for Squamous Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer.;"Background. Standard first-line therapy for metastatic, squamous non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is platinum-based chemotherapy or pembrolizumab (for patients with programmed death ligand 1 [PD-L1] expression on ≥50% of tumor cells). More recently, pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy was shown to significantly prolong overall survival among patients with nonsquamous NSCLC. Methods. In this double-blind, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, 559 patients with untreated metastatic, squamous NSCLC to receive 200 mg of pembrolizumab or saline placebo for up to 35 cycles; all the patients also received carboplatin and either paclitaxel or nanoparticle albumin-bound [nab]-paclitaxel for the first 4 cycles. Primary end points were overall survival and progression-free survival. Results. After a median follow-up of 7.8 months, the median overall survival was 15.9 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 13.2 to not reached) in the pembrolizumab-combination group and 11.3 months (95% CI, 9.5 to 14.8) in the placebo-combination group (hazard ratio for death, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.49 to 0.85; P<0.001). The overall survival benefit was consistent regardless of the level of PD-L1 expression. The median progression-free survival was 6.4 months (95% CI, 6.2 to 8.3) in the pembrolizumab-combination group and 4.8 months (95% CI, 4.3 to 5.7) in the placebo-combination group (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.70; P<0.001). Adverse events of grade 3 or higher occurred in 69.8% of the patients in the pembrolizumab-combination group and in 68.2% of the patients in the placebo-combination group. Discontinuation of treatment because of adverse events was more frequent in the pembrolizumab-combination group than in the placebo-combination group (13.3% vs. 6.4%). Conclusions. In patients with previously untreated metastatic, squamous NSCLC, the addition of pembrolizumab to chemotherapy with carboplatin plus paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel resulted in significantly longer overall survival and progression-free survival than chemotherapy alone.

280;30284154;Treatment of Disfiguring Cutaneous Lesions in Neurofibromatosis-1 with Everolimus: A Phase II, Open-Label, Single-Arm Trial.;"Background. Cutaneous neurofibromas cause disfigurement and discomfort in individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1). Methods. The primary objective of this phase II, open-label, single-arm trial was to assess whether orally administered everolimus reduced the surface volume of cutaneous neurofibromas in patients with NF-1. Results. Of 22 patients who took the study drug, 17 completed the trial; 5 patients withdrew due to adverse events. Sixteen patients had photographs of sufficient quality for assessment of the primary outcome. A significant reduction in lesion surface volume, defined as an end of trial volume > 2 standard errors (SE) less than baseline volume, was observed for 4/31 lesions (13%) from 3/16 patients (19%). Additionally, a statistically significant absolute change in average height for paired lesions was observed (p = 0.048). Although not a prespecified outcome measure, a dramatic reduction in the size of 3 large plexiform neurofibromas with a cutaneous component was also noted and documented by measurement of maximum circumference or magnetic resonance imaging-based volumetric analysis. Adverse events were common in this trial, but no serious adverse events occurred. Conclusions. Although this was a small, exploratory trial that was not powered for significance, the reduction in surface volume observed in this study is noteworthy assuming that the natural course for untreated lesions is to maintain or increase in volume. Future studies are needed with larger study populations that incorporate longer durations of treatment and better standardization of volumetric measurements.

281;30516102;Trastuzumab Emtansine for Residual Invasive HER2-Positive Breast Cancer.;"Background. Patients who have residual invasive breast cancer after receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-targeted therapy have a worse prognosis than those who have no residual cancer. Trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1), an antibody-drug conjugate of trastuzumab and the cytotoxic agent emtansine (DM1), a maytansine derivative and microtubule inhibitor, provides benefit in patients with metastatic breast cancer that was previously treated with chemotherapy plus HER2-targeted therapy. Methods. We conducted a phase 3, open-label trial involving patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer who were found to have residual invasive disease in the breast or axilla at surgery after receiving neoadjuvant therapy containing a taxane (with or without anthracycline) and trastuzumab. Patients were randomly assigned to receive adjuvant T-DM1 or trastuzumab for 14 cycles. The primary end point was invasive disease-free survival (defined as freedom from ipsilateral invasive breast tumor recurrence, ipsilateral locoregional invasive breast cancer recurrence, contralateral invasive breast cancer, distant recurrence, or death from any cause). Results. At the interim analysis, among 1486 randomly assigned patients (743 in the T-DM1 group and 743 in the trastuzumab group), invasive disease or death had occurred in 91 patients in the T-DM1 group (12.2%) and 165 patients in the trastuzumab group (22.2%). The estimated percentage of patients who were free of invasive disease at 3 years was 88.3% in the T-DM1 group and 77.0% in the trastuzumab group. Invasive disease-free survival was significantly higher in the T-DM1 group than in the trastuzumab group (hazard ratio for invasive disease or death, 0.50; 95% confidence interval, 0.39 to 0.64; P<0.001). Distant recurrence as the first invasive-disease event occurred in 10.5% of patients in the T-DM1 group and 15.9% of those in the trastuzumab group. The safety data were consistent with the known safety profile of T-DM1, with more adverse events associated with T-DM1 than with trastuzumab alone. Conclusions. Among patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer who had residual invasive disease after completion of neoadjuvant therapy, the risk of recurrence of invasive breast cancer or death was 50% lower with adjuvant T-DM1 than with trastuzumab alone.

In this phase II study, dendritic cells transfected with wild-type TP53 (vaccine) were administered to patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer after chemotherapy. Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to arm A (observation), arm B (vaccine alone), or arm C (vaccine plus all-trans-retinoic acid). Vaccine was administered every 2 weeks (3 times), and all patients were to receive paclitaxel at progression. Our primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR) to paclitaxel. The study was not designed to detect overall response rate differences between arms. Of 69 patients enrolled (performance status 0/1, median age 62 years), 55 were treated in stage 1 (18 in arm A, 20 in arm B, and 17 in arm C) and 14 in stage 2 (arm C only), per 2-stage Simon Minimax design. The vaccine was safe, with mostly grade 1/2 toxicities, although 1 arm-B patient experienced grade 3 fatigue and 8 arm-C patients experienced grade 3 toxicities. Positive immune responses were obtained in 20% of arm B (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.3-48.6) and 43.3% of arm C (95% CI 23.9-65.1). The ORRs to the second-line chemotherapy (including paclitaxel) were 15.4% (95% CI 2.7-46.3), 16.7% (95% CI 2.9-49.1), and 23.8% (95% CI 9.1-47.5) for arms A, B, and C, with no survival differences between arms. Although our vaccine failed to improve ORRs to the second-line chemotherapy, its safety profile and therapeutic immune potential remain.

283;30635165;A phase 1 study of veliparib, a PARP-1/2 inhibitor, with gemcitabine and radiotherapy in locally advanced pancreatic cancer.;"Background. Locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) has a dismal prognosis with current treatment modalities and one-third of patients die from local progression of disease. Preclinical studies with orthotopic PC demonstrated dramatic synergy between radiotherapy (RT) and the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1/2 inhibitor (PARPi), veliparib. We conducted a phase I trial of gemcitabine, radiotherapy and dose-escalated veliparib in LAPC. Methods. This was a single institution investigator-initiated open-label, single-arm phase 1 clinical trial (NCT01908478). Weekly gemcitabine with daily IMRT and veliparib dose escalated using a Bayesian adaptive design were administered in treatment naive LA or borderline resectable PC. The primary end point was identification of the MTD. Secondary endpoints included efficacy, characterization of PAR levels using ELISA, DDR alterations with targeted next generation sequencing and transcriptome analysis, tumor mutation burden (TMB) and microsatellite instability (MSI) status. Findings. Thirty patients were enrolled. The MTD of veliparib was 40 mg BID with gemcitabine 400 mg/m2 and RT (36 Gy/15 fractions). Sixteen DLTs were identified in 12 patients. Grade ≥ 3 adverse events included lymphopenia (96%) and anemia (36%). Median OS for all patients was 15 months. Median OS for DDR pathway gene altered and intact cases was 19 months (95% CI: 6.2-27.2) and 14 months (95% CI: 10.0-21.8), respectively. There were no significant associations between levels of PAR, TMB, or MSI with outcomes. The DDR transcripts PARP3 and RBX1 significantly correlated with OS. Interpretation. This is the first report of a PARPi-chemoradiotherapy combination in PC. The regimen was safe, tolerable at the RP2D, and clinically active as an upfront treatment strategy in patients biologically unselected by upfront chemotherapy. Expression of the DDR transcripts, PARP3 and RBX1, were associated with OS suggesting validation in a follow up phase 2 study.

284;30642819;Safety and activity of ibrutinib in combination with nivolumab in patients with relapsed non-Hodgkin lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukaemia: a phase 1/2a study.;"Background. Preclinical studies have shown synergistic antitumour effects between ibrutinib and immune-checkpoint blockade. The aim of this study was to assess the safety and activity of ibrutinib in combination with nivolumab in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell malignant diseases. Methods. We did a two-part, open-label, phase 1/2a study at 21 hospitals in Australia, Israel, Poland, Spain, Turkey, and the USA. The primary objective of part A (dose escalation) was to assess the safety of daily oral ibrutinib (420 mg or 560 mg) in combination with intravenous nivolumab (3 mg/kg every 2 weeks) to ascertain a recommended phase 2 dose in patients with relapsed or refractory high-risk chronic lymphocytic leukaemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma (del17p or del11q), follicular lymphoma, or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Dose optimisation was investigated using a modified toxicity probability interval design. The primary objective of the part B expansion phase was to establish the preliminary activity (the proportion of patients who achieved an overall response) of the combination of ibrutinib and nivolumab in four cohorts: relapsed or refractory high-risk chronic lymphocytic leukaemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma (del17p or del11q), follicular lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and Richter's transformation. All participants who received at least one dose of treatment were included in the primary analysis and analyses were done by disease cohort. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02329847. The trial is ongoing. Findings. Between March 12, 2015, and April 11, 2017, 144 patients were enrolled in the study. Three patients died before receiving study treatment; thus, 141 patients were included in the analysis, 14 in part A and 127 in part B. One dose-limiting toxicity (grade 3 hyperbilirubinaemia) was reported at the 420 mg dose in the diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cohort, which resolved after 5 days. The combination of ibrutinib and nivolumab led to overall responses in 22 (61%) of 36 patients with high-risk chronic lymphocytic leukaemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma, 13 (33%) of 40 patients with follicular lymphoma, 16 (36%) of 45 patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and 13 (65%) of 20 patients with Richter's transformation. The most common all-grade adverse events were diarrhoea (47 [33%] of 141 patients), neutropenia (44 [31%]), and fatigue (37 [26%]). 11 (8%) of 141 patients had adverse events leading to death; none were reported as drug-related. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were neutropenia (40 [28%] of 141 patients) and anaemia (32 [23%]). The incidence of grade 3-4 neutropenia ranged from eight (18%) of 45 patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma to 19 (53%) of 36 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma; incidence of grade 3-4 anaemia ranged from five (13%) of 40 patients with follicular lymphoma to seven (35%) of 20 patients with Richter's transformation. The most common serious adverse events included anaemia (six [4%] of 141 patients) and pneumonia (five [4%]). The most common grade 3-4 immune-related adverse events were rash (11 [8%] of 141 patients) and increased alanine aminotransferase (three [2%]). Interpretation. The combination of ibrutinib and nivolumab had an acceptable safety profile and preliminary activity was similar to that reported with single-agent ibrutinib in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The clinical response in patients with Richter's transformation was promising and supports further clinical assessment. Funding. Janssen R&D.";Neoplasms;Interventional;Indomain;Train

Platinum-based chemotherapy is the first-line treatment for lung cancer patients, especially those in advanced stages. In the present study, we investigated the association of STAT3 polymorphism rs4796793 with lung cancer susceptibility, platinum-based chemotherapy response, and toxicity. Methods. A total of 498 lung cancer patients and 213 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. 467 of them received at least 2-cycle platinum-based chemotherapy. Unconditional logistical regression analysis was used to assess the associations. Results.

286;30692121;A phase 1 trial of ibrutinib plus palbociclib in previously treated mantle cell lymphoma.;"Single-agent ibrutinib is active in patients with previously treated mantle cell lymphoma (MCL); however, nearly half of all patients experience treatment failure during the first year. We previously demonstrated that prolonged early G1 cell cycle arrest induced by the oral, specific CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib can overcome ibrutinib resistance in primary human MCL cells and MCL cell lines expressing wild-type Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK). Therefore, we conducted a phase 1 trial to evaluate the dosing, safety, and preliminary activity of palbociclib plus ibrutinib in patients with previously treated mantle cell lymphoma. From August 2014 to June 2016, a total of 27 patients (21 men, 6 women) were enrolled. The maximum tolerated doses were ibrutinib 560 mg daily plus palbociclib 100 mg on days 1 to 21 of each 28-day cycle. The dose-limiting toxicity was grade 3 rash. The most common grade 3 to 4 toxicities included neutropenia (41%), thrombocytopenia (30%), hypertension (15%), febrile neutropenia (15%), and lung infection (11%). The overall and complete response rates were 67% and 37%, and with a median follow-up of 25.6 months, the 2-year progression-free survival was 59.4% and the 2-year response duration was 69.8%.

287;30708264;Safety of trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) in patients with HER2-positive advanced breast cancer: Primary results from the KAMILLA study cohort 1.;"Background. Many patients with metastatic human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer (BC) are candidates for trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) treatment sometime in their disease history. KAMILLA evaluated safety of T-DM1 in patients with previously treated HER2-positive locally advanced or metastatic BC (advanced BC). Methods. KAMILLA (NCT01702571) is a single-arm, open-label, international, phase IIIb safety study of patients with HER2-positive advanced BC with progression after prior treatment with chemotherapy and a HER2-directed agent for MBC or within 6 months of completing adjuvant therapy. Patients received T-DM1 (3.6 mg/kg every 3 weeks) until unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal or disease progression. Results. Among 2002 treated patients, median age was 55 years (range, 26-88; 373 [18.6%] aged ≥65 years), 1321 (66.0%) received ≥2 prior metastatic treatment lines and 398 (19.9%) had baseline central nervous system metastases. Adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs occurred in 1862 (93.0%) and 427 (21.3%) patients, respectively. Grade ≥3 AEs occurred in 751 (37.5%) patients; the three most common (individual Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activity terms) were anaemia (3.0%), thrombocytopaenia (2.7%) and fatigue (2.5%). Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 6.9 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.0-7.6). Median overall survival (OS) was 27.2 months (95% CI, 25.5-28.7). With increasing lines of prior advanced therapy (0-1 versus 4+), median PFS and OS decreased numerically from 8.3 to 5.6 months and from 31.3 to 22.5 months, respectively. Conclusions. KAMILLA is the largest cohort of T-DM1-treated patients studied to date. Results are consistent with prior randomised studies, thereby supporting T-DM1 as safe, tolerable and efficacious treatment for patients with previously treated HER2-positive advanced BC.";Neoplasms;Interventional;Indomain;Train
288;30771200;A multicenter phase II study of temozolomide plus disulfiram and copper for recurrent temozolomide-resistant glioblastoma.;Purpose. Preclinical studies have suggested promising activity for the combination of disulfiram and copper (DSF/Cu) against glioblastoma (GBM) including re-sensitization to temozolomide (TMZ). A previous phase I study demonstrated the safety of combining DSF/Cu with adjuvant TMZ for newly diagnosed GBM. This phase II study aimed to estimate the potential effectiveness of DSF/Cu to re-sensitize recurrent GBM to TMZ. Methods. This open-label, single-arm phase II study treated recurrent TMZ-resistant GBM patients with standard monthly TMZ plus concurrent daily DSF 80 mg PO TID and Cu 1.5 mg PO TID. Eligible patients must have progressed after standard chemoradiotherapy and within 3 months of the last dose of TMZ. Known isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutant or secondary GBMs were excluded. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR), and the secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), clinical benefit (response or stable disease for at least 6 months), and safety. Results. From March 2017 to January 2018, 23 recurrent TMZ-resistant GBM patients were enrolled across seven centers, and 21 patients were evaluable for response. The median duration of DSF/Cu was 1.6 cycles (range: 0.1-12.0). The ORR was 0%, but 14% had clinical benefit. Median PFS was 1.7 months, and median OS was 7.1 months. Only one patient (4%) had dose-limiting toxicity (grade three elevated alanine transaminase). Conclusions. Addition of DSF/Cu to TMZ for TMZ-resistant IDH-wild type GBM appears well tolerated but has limited activity for unselected population.;Neoplasms;Interventional;Indomain;Train
289;30897038;AUGMENT: A Phase III Study of Lenalidomide Plus Rituximab Versus Placebo Plus Rituximab in Relapsed or Refractory Indolent Lymphoma.;"Purpose. Patients with indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma typically respond well to first-line immunochemotherapy. At relapse, single-agent rituximab is commonly administered. Data suggest the immunomodulatory agent lenalidomide could increase the activity of rituximab. Methods. A phase III, multicenter, randomized trial of lenalidomide plus rituximab versus placebo plus rituximab was conducted in patients with relapsed and/or refractory follicular or marginal zone lymphoma. Patients received lenalidomide or placebo for 12 cycles plus rituximab once per week for 4 weeks in cycle 1 and day 1 of cycles 2 through 5. The primary end point was progression-free survival per independent radiology review. Results. A total of 358 patients were randomly assigned to lenalidomide plus rituximab (n = 178) or placebo plus rituximab (n = 180). Infections (63% v 49%), neutropenia (58% v 23%), and cutaneous reactions (32% v 12%) were more common with lenalidomide plus rituximab. Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (50% v 13%) and leukopenia (7% v 2%) were higher with lenalidomide plus rituximab; no other grade 3 or 4 adverse event differed by 5% or more between groups. Progression-free survival was significantly improved for lenalidomide plus rituximab versus placebo plus rituximab, with a hazard ratio of 0.46 (95% CI, 0.34 to 0.62; P < .001) and median duration of 39.4 months (95% CI, 22.9 months to not reached) versus 14.1 months (95% CI, 11.4 to 16.7 months), respectively.

290;30938103;A phase I/II trial of weekly nab-paclitaxel for pretreated non-small-cell lung cancer patients without epidermal growth factor receptor mutations and anaplastic lymphoma kinase rearrangement.;Aim. We investigated the efficacy, safety and optimal schedule of nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel monotherapy as second- or third-line treatment for non-small-cell lung cancer patients without epidermal growth factor receptor mutation and anaplastic lymphoma kinase rearrangement. Methods. Patients with pretreated advanced non-small-cell lung cancer without epidermal growth factor receptor mutation and anaplastic lymphoma kinase rearrangement were included. The patients were administered 100 mg/m2 of nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 (level 0) or on days 1, 8 and 15 (level -1) every 4 weeks during phase I of the trial. The primary endpoint was objective response rate. The estimated objective response rate was 15% and the threshold was 5% with an α error of 0.05 and β error of 0.2 in phase II. Results. The recommended schedule was determined as level -1 in phase I. The characteristics of the 55 patients enrolled in phase II were as follows: median age = 66 years, male/female = 40/15, second/third line = 34/21 and adenocarcinoma/squamous cell carcinoma/large cell carcinoma/others = 34/17/2/2. Objective response rate was 7.3% (95% confidence interval, 2.0-17.6%). Median progression-free survival was 3.4 months. Treatment-related grade 3 or 4 toxicities were neutropenia (36.4%), febrile neutropenia (5.5%) and pulmonary infection (3.6%). Three patients had grade 2 pneumonitis and one treatment-related death occurred due to adult respiratory distress syndrome. Conclusion. This study failed to meet predefined primary endpoints for pretreated patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer without epidermal growth factor receptor mutation and anaplastic lymphoma kinase rearrangement.;Neoplasms;Interventional;Indomain;Train
291;30959557;Long-term follow up of nivolumab in previously untreated Japanese patients with advanced or recurrent malignant melanoma.;The immune checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab inhibits the programmed death 1 receptor and suppresses the immune resistance of cancer cells. This is a long-term follow up of a single-arm, open-label, multicenter, phase II study of nivolumab in untreated Japanese patients with stage III/IV or recurrent melanoma. In addition, a post-hoc subgroup analysis stratified by melanoma types was performed. Nivolumab was administered intravenously at a dose of 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks. The primary endpoint was the overall response rate (ORR), and secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), best overall response, the disease control rate and change in tumor diameter. Safety was assessed by recording treatment-related adverse events (TRAE), including select immune-related adverse events. Of the 24 patients initially included in the primary phase II study, 10 survived for over 3 years (41.7%). The ORR was 34.8% (90% confidence interval [CI]: 20.8, 51.9) for all patients. When analyzing by melanoma type, the ORR was 66.7% (90% CI: 34.7, 88.3) for superficial spreading, 33.3% (90% CI: 11.7, 65.3) for mucosal, and 28.6% (90% CI: 10.0, 59.1) for acral lentiginous tumors. The median OS was 32.9 months, the 3-year OS rate was 43.5%, and the 3-year PFS rate was 17.2%. A long-term response was observed in all the tumor types. The most common TRAE included skin toxicity (45.8%) and endocrine disorders (29.2%).

292;31018069;Tagraxofusp in Blastic Plasmacytoid Dendritic-Cell Neoplasm.;"Background. Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic-cell neoplasm (BPDCN) is an aggressive hematologic cancer that is caused by transformed plasmacytoid dendritic cells that overexpress interleukin-3 receptor subunit alpha (IL3RA or CD123). Tagraxofusp (SL-401) is a CD123-directed cytotoxin consisting of human interleukin-3 fused to truncated diphtheria toxin. Methods. In this open-label, multicohort study, we assigned 47 patients with untreated or relapsed BPDCN to receive an intravenous infusion of tagraxofusp at a dose of 7 μg or 12 μg per kilogram of body weight on days 1 to 5 of each 21-day cycle. Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxic effects. The primary outcome was the combined rate of complete response and clinical complete response among patients who had not received previous treatment for BPDCN. A secondary outcome was the duration of response. Results. Of the 47 patients, 32 were receiving tagraxofusp as first-line treatment and 15 had received previous treatment. The median age of the patients was 70 years (range, 22 to 84). Among the 29 previously untreated patients who received tagraxofusp at a dose of 12 μg per kilogram, the primary outcome occurred in 21 (72%), and the overall response rate was 90%; of these patients, 45% went on to undergo stem-cell transplantation. Survival rates at 18 and 24 months were 59% and 52%, respectively. Among the 15 previously treated patients, the response rate was 67%, and the median overall survival was 8.5 months. The most common adverse events were increased levels of alanine aminotransferase (64%) and aspartate aminotransferase (60%), hypoalbuminemia (55%), peripheral edema (51%), and thrombocytopenia (49%). Capillary leak syndrome was reported in 19% of the patients and was associated with one death in each of the dose subgroups. Conclusions. In adult patients with untreated or relapsed BPDCN, the use of tagraxofusp led to clinical responses. Serious adverse events included capillary leak syndrome; hepatic dysfunction and thrombocytopenia were common.

293;31090260;Phase II APEC trial: The impact of primary tumor side on outcomes of first-line cetuximab plus FOLFOX or FOLFIRI in patients with RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer.;"Aim. The open-label, nonrandomized, phase II APEC study enrolled 167 patients with RAS wild-type (wt) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) to investigate the safety and efficacy of first-line, every-2-weeks cetuximab plus investigator's choice of FOLFIRI or FOLFOX in this patient population. Methods. A subgroup analysis of the APEC study population by primary tumor location was performed. Results. A total of 130 patients (81.8%) had left-sided and 29 (18.2%) had right-sided mCRC. Median progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and overall response rate (ORR) were 14.0 months, 30.6 months and 68.5% for patients with left-sided tumors and 8.9 months, 24.6 months and 51.7% for patients with right-sided mCRC, concurring with pivotal phase III trial results. In patients with right-sided tumors, median PFS was 15.4 months vs 8.3 months with cetuximab plus FOLFIRI vs cetuximab plus FOLFOX, respectively; median OS was 32.1 months vs 21.8 months with cetuximab plus FOLFIRI vs cetuximab plus FOLFOX, respectively. Conclusion. The APEC tumor-location subgroup analysis results were largely consistent with available literature regarding the equivalent efficacy of cetuximab plus FOLFIRI/FOLFOX in patients with left-sided RAS wt mCRC. A trend toward improved efficacy with cetuximab plus FOLFIRI compared with cetuximab plus FOLFOX was observed in patients with right-sided tumors; however, a direct comparison between groups cannot be made due to the nonrandomized study design. Nevertheless, the similar ORR observed with either chemotherapy backbone in patients with right-sided RAS wt mCRC suggests a potential role for both regimens in this patient population when cytoreduction is a treatment goal.";Neoplasms;Interventional;Indomain;Train
294;31150574;Apalutamide for Metastatic, Castration-Sensitive Prostate Cancer.;"Background. Apalutamide is an inhibitor of the ligand-binding domain of the androgen receptor. Whether the addition of apalutamide to androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) would prolong radiographic progression-free survival and overall survival as compared with placebo plus ADT among patients with metastatic, castration-sensitive prostate cancer has not been determined. Methods. In this double-blind, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned patients with metastatic, castration-sensitive prostate cancer to receive apalutamide (240 mg per day) or placebo, added to ADT. Previous treatment for localized disease and previous docetaxel therapy were allowed. The primary end points were radiographic progression-free survival and overall survival. Results. A total of 525 patients were assigned to receive apalutamide plus ADT and 527 to receive placebo plus ADT. The median age was 68 years. A total of 16.4% of the patients had undergone prostatectomy or received radiotherapy for localized disease, and 10.7% had received previous docetaxel therapy; 62.7% had high-volume disease, and 37.3% had low-volume disease. At the first interim analysis, with a median of 22.7 months of follow-up, the percentage of patients with radiographic progression-free survival at 24 months was 68.2% in the apalutamide group and 47.5% in the placebo group (hazard ratio for radiographic progression or death, 0.48; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.39 to 0.60; P<0.001). Overall survival at 24 months was also greater with apalutamide than with placebo (82.4% in the apalutamide group vs. 73.5% in the placebo group; hazard ratio for death, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.89; P = 0.005). The frequency of grade 3 or 4 adverse events was 42.2% in the apalutamide group and 40.8% in the placebo group; rash was more common in the apalutamide group. Conclusions. In this trial involving patients with metastatic, castration-sensitive prostate cancer, overall survival and radiographic progression-free survival were significantly longer with the addition of apalutamide to ADT than with placebo plus ADT, and the side-effect profile did not differ substantially between the two groups.

Here we performed a randomized phase 2 trial ( NCT02130466 ), in which patients with treatment-naive BRAFV600E/K-mutant, advanced melanoma received the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib and the MEK inhibitor trametinib together with the PD-1-blocking antibody pembrolizumab (triplet; n = 60) or placebo (doublet; n = 60). The primary end point of progression-free survival was numerically improved in the triplet group-16.0 months-compared with 10.3 months in the doublet group (hazard ratio, 0.66; P = 0.043); however, the trial did not reach the planned benefit for a statistically significant improvement. Median duration of response was 18.7 months (95% confidence interval, 10.1-22.1) and 12.5 months (95% confidence interval, 6.0-14.1); 59.8 and 27.8% of responses were estimated to have lasted for more than 18 months for triplet and doublet treatment, respectively. Grade 3-5 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 58.3 and 26.7% of patients treated with triplet and doublet therapies, respectively, which were most commonly fever, increased transaminase levels and rash. One patient who received triplet therapy died of pneumonitis. In summary, triplet therapy with dabrafenib, trametinib and pembrolizumab conferred numerically longer progression-free survival and duration of response with a higher rate of grade 3/4 adverse events compared with the doublet therapy of dabrafenib, trametinib and placebo.";Neoplasms;Interventional;Indomain;Train

S1400D is a biomarker-driven therapeutic substudy of Lung-MAP evaluating the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor (FGFR) inhibitor AZD4547 in patients with FGF pathway-activated squamous cell. This is the first phase II trial to evaluate AZD4547 as a targeted approach in patients with previously treated FGFR-altered squamous cell NSCLC and is the first demonstration of successful implementation and conduct of a national umbrella protocol in this disease setting. Methods. Eligible patients had tumoral FGFR alteration or mutation and had progressive disease after at least one line of platinum-based systemic therapy. Patients received AZD4547 80 mg twice daily orally. Primary endpoint was response by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1; secondary endpoints included progression-free survival, overall survival, and duration of response (DoR). Results. Ninety-two patients were assigned to S1400D, 43 were enrolled, and 27 AZD4547-treated patients were evaluable. Evaluable patients were predominantly white (n = 24, 89%), median age 66 years (range, 49-88 years old), and female (n = 7, 26%). FGFR alterations included FGFR1 amplification (n = 23; 85%), FGFR3 amplification (n = 2; 7%), FGFR3 S249C (n = 2; 7%), and FGFR3 fusion (n = 1; 4%). Treatment with ADZ4547 was well tolerated; grade 3 adverse events occurred in six patients, and one patient had grade 4 sepsis. Of 27 response-evaluable patients, 1 patient with FGFR3 S249C had unconfirmed partial response with a DoR of 1.5 months and 1 patient with FGFR1 amplification had a confirmed partial response with a DoR of 2.9 months (7%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0%-17%). Median progression-free survival and overall survival for the AZD4547-treated cohort were 2.7 months (95% CI: 1.4- 4.5 months) and 7.5 months (95% CI: 3.7-9.3 months). Conclusions.

297;31208944;Ibrutinib plus fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab as initial treatment for younger patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia: a single-arm, multicentre, phase 2 trial.;"Background. Fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR) can improve disease-free survival for younger (age ≤65 years) fit patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia with mutated IGHV. However, patients with unmutated IGHV rarely have durable responses. Ibrutinib is active for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia irrespective of IGHV mutation status but requires continuous treatment. We postulated that time-limited ibrutinib plus FCR would induce durable responses in younger fit patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Methods. We did a multicentre, open-label, non-randomised, single-arm phase 2 trial at seven sites in the USA. We enrolled patients aged 65 years or younger with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Our initial cohort (original cohort) was not restricted by prognostic marker status and included patients who had del(17p) or TP53 aberrations. After a protocol amendment (on March 21, 2017), we enrolled an additional cohort (expansion cohort) that included patients without del(17p). Ibrutinib was given orally (420 mg/day) for 7 days, then up to six 28-day cycles were administered intravenously of fludarabine (25 mg/m2, days 1-3), cyclophosphamide (250 mg/m2, days 1-3), and rituximab (375 mg/m2 day 1 of cycle 1; 500 mg/m2 day 1 of cycles 2-6) with continuous oral ibrutinib (420 mg/day). Responders continued on ibrutinib maintenance for up to 2 years, and patients with undetectable minimal residual disease in bone marrow after 2 years were able to discontinue treatment. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved a complete response with undetectable minimal residual disease in bone marrow 2 months after the last cycle of ibrutinib plus FCR. Analyses were done per-protocol in all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02251548) and is ongoing. Findings. Between Oct 23, 2014, and April 23, 2018, 85 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia were enrolled. del(17p) was detected in four (5%) of 83 patients and TP53 mutations were noted in three (4%) of 81 patients; two patients had both del(17p) and TP53 mutations. Median patients' age was 55 years (IQR 50-58). At data cutoff, median follow-up was 16·5 months (IQR 10·6-34·1). A complete response and undetectable minimal residual disease in bone marrow 2 months after the last cycle of ibrutinib plus FCR was achieved by 28 (33%, 95% CI 0·23-0·44) of 85 patients (p=0·0035 compared with a 20% historical value with FCR alone). A best response of undetectable minimal residual disease in bone marrow was achieved by 71 (84%) of 85 patients during the study. One patient had disease progression and one patient died (sudden cardiac death after 17 months of ibrutinib maintenance, assessed as possibly related to ibrutinib). The most common all-grade toxic effects were haematological, including thrombocytopenia in 63 (74%) patients, neutropenia in 53 (62%), and anaemia in 41 (49%). Grade 3 or 4 non-haematological serious adverse events included grade 3 atrial fibrillation in three (4%) patients and grade 3 Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in two (2%). Interpretation. The proportion of patients who achieved undetectable minimal residual disease in bone marrow with ibrutinib plus FCR is, to our knowledge, the highest ever published in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia unrestricted by prognostic marker status. Ibrutinib plus FCR is promising as a time-limited combination regimen for frontline chronic lymphocytic leukaemia treatment in younger fit patients. Funding.

298;31229240;Pexidartinib versus placebo for advanced tenosynovial giant cell tumour (ENLIVEN): a randomised phase 3 trial.;"Background. Tenosynovial giant cell tumour (TGCT), a rare, locally aggressive neoplasm, overexpresses colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF1). Surgery is standard with no approved systemic therapy. We aimed to evaluate pexidartinib, a CSF1 receptor inhibitor, in patients with TGCT to provide them with a viable systemic treatment option, especially in cases that are not amenable to surgical resection. Methods. This phase 3 randomised trial had two parts. Part one was a double-blind study in which patients with symptomatic, advanced TGCT for whom surgery was not recommended were randomly assigned via an integrated web response system (1:1) to the pexidartinib or placebo group. Individuals in the pexidartinib group received a loading dose of 1000 mg pexidartinib per day orally (400 mg morning; 600 mg evening) for the first 2 weeks, followed by 800 mg per day (400 mg twice a day) for 22 weeks. Part two was an open-label study of pexidartinib for all patients. The primary endpoint, assessed in all intention-to-treat patients, was overall response at week 25, and was centrally reviewed by RECIST, version 1.1. Safety was analysed in all patients who received at least one dose of the study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02371369. Findings. Between May 11, 2015, and Sept 30, 2016, of 174 patients assessed for eligibility, 120 patients were randomly assigned to, and received, pexidartinib (n=61) or placebo (n=59). There were 11 dropouts in the placebo group and nine in the pexidartinib group. Emergence of mixed or cholestatic hepatotoxicity caused the data monitoring committee to stop enrolment six patients short of target. The proportion of patients who achieved overall response was higher for pexidartinib than placebo at week 25 by RECIST (24 [39%] of 61 vs none of 59; absolute difference 39% [95% CI 27-53]; p<0·0001). Serious adverse events occurred in eight (13%) of 61 patients in the pexidartinib group and one (2%) of 59 patients in the placebo group. Hair colour changes (67%), fatigue (54%), aspartate aminotransferase increase (39%), nausea (38%), alanine aminotransferase increase (28%), and dysgeusia (25%) were the most frequent pexidartinib-associated adverse events. Three patients given pexidartinib had aminotransferase elevations three or more times the upper limit of normal with total bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase two or more times the upper limit of normal indicative of mixed or cholestatic hepatotoxicity, one lasting 7 months and confirmed by biopsy. Interpretation. Pexidartinib is the first systemic therapy to show a robust tumour response in TGCT with improved patient symptoms and functional outcomes; mixed or cholestatic hepatotoxicity is an identified risk. Pexidartinib could be considered as a potential treatment for TGCT associated with severe morbidity or functional limitations in cases not amenable to improvement with surgery. Funding.

Docetaxel combined with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) has improved patient survival for advanced prostate cancer (PCa). Objective. This randomised trial aimed to evaluate whether six courses of docetaxel improved biochemical disease-free survival (BDFS) after radical radiotherapy (RT) for intermediate- or high-risk PCa patients. Design, setting, and participants. A total of 376 patients were randomised in this multinational phase III study, and received either six cycles of adjuvant docetaxel 75 mg/m2 every 3 wk without continuous prednisone (arm A, n = 188) or surveillance (arm B, n = 188) after RT (NTC006653848). Neoadjuvant/adjuvant ADT was mandatory for all the patients. The primary endpoint was rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ≥2 ng/ml above the nadir PSA value. Intermediate- or high-risk PCa was defined as T2 with a Gleason score (GS) of 4 + 3, PSA > 10; T2, GS 8-10, ≤ 70 ng/ml; or any T3. The patients were followed for 5 yr by assessing PSA levels every 3 mo for 2 yr and every 6 mo thereafter. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis. The study power was 89% to detect a difference in BDFS between groups, and the sample size calculation accounted for the T2/T3 distribution, where a 12%/15% difference in BDFS was assumed for the T2/T3 patients. Results and limitations. All six cycles were completed in 147 (78%) of the patients in arm A. The median age was 67 yr in both treatment groups, 75% had T3 disease, and 47% had GS 8-10. The median follow-up was 59 mo (range 1-111 mo). The primary endpoint was observed for 58 patients in arm A (docetaxel) and for 57 patients in arm B (surveillance). The Kaplan-Meier analysis showed no difference in the BDFS curves (p = 0.6) between the treatment groups. The 5-yr estimated biochemical progression rates were 31% for arm A and 28% for arm B. Febrile neutropenia occurred in 16% of the docetaxel patients. No deaths were related to the docetaxel treatment. There were 43 deaths during the trial, including 20 in arm A and 23 in arm B, of which nine and seven, respectively, were due to PCa. The hazard ratio from Cox multivariate analysis for PSA progression of arm A (docetaxel) versus arm B (surveillance) was 1.14 (95% confidence interval 0.79-1.64, p = 0.5). Conclusions. Adjuvant docetaxel without prednisone did not improve BDFS after radical RT with ADT for intermediate- or high-risk PCa. Patient summary. We compared six cycles of adjuvant docetaxel given after radical external radiotherapy plus androgen deprivation therapy to surveillance in intermediate- and high-risk localised prostate cancer. We found no overall benefit in this setting.";Neoplasms;Interventional;Indomain;Train
300;10379018;Long-term treatment with inhaled budesonide in persons with mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who continue smoking. European Respiratory Society Study on Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.;"Background Although patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) should stop smoking, some do not. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we evaluated the effect of the inhaled glucocorticoid budesonide in patients with mild COPD who continued smoking. After a six-month run-in period, we randomly assigned 1277 subjects (mean age, 52 years; mean forced expiratory volume in one second [FEV1], 77 percent of the predicted value; 73 percent men) to twice-daily treatment with 400 microg of budesonide or placebo, inhaled from a dry-powder inhaler, for three years. Results Of the 1277 subjects, 912 (71 percent) completed the study. Among these subjects, the median decline in the FEV1 after the use of a bronchodilator over the three-year period was 140 ml in the budesonide group and 180 ml in the placebo group (P=0.05), or 4.3 percent and 5.3 percent of the predicted value, respectively. During the first six months of the study, the FEV1 improved at the rate of 17 ml per year in the budesonide group, as compared with a decline of 81 ml per year in the placebo group (P<0.001). From nine months to the end of treatment, the FEV1 declined at similar rates in the two groups (P=0.39). Ten percent of the subjects in the budesonide group and 4 percent of those in the placebo group had skin bruising (P<0.001). Newly diagnosed hypertension, bone fractures, postcapsular cataracts, myopathy, and diabetes occurred in less than 5 percent of the subjects, and the diagnoses were equally distributed between the groups. Conclusions In patients with mild COPD who continue smoking, the use of inhaled budesonide is associated with a small one-time improvement in lung function but does not appreciably affect the long-term progressive decline.";Respiratory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train
301;10807619;Randomised, double blind, placebo controlled study of fluticasone propionate in patients with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: the ISOLDE trial.;Objectives To determine the effect of long term inhaled corticosteroids on lung function, exacerbations, and health status in patients with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Design Double blind, placebo controlled study. Setting Eighteen UK hospitals. Participants 751 men and women aged between 40 and 75 years with mean forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1)) 50% of predicted normal. Interventions Inhaled fluticasone propionate 500 microgram twice daily from a metered dose inhaler or identical placebo. Main outcome measures Efficacy measures: rate of decline in FEV(1) after the bronchodilator and in health status, frequency of exacerbations, respiratory withdrawals. Safety measures: morning serum cortisol concentration, incidence of adverse events. Results There was no significant difference in the annual rate of decline in FEV(1 )(P=0.16). Mean FEV(1) after bronchodilator remained significantly higher throughout the study with fluticasone propionate compared with placebo (P<0.001). Median exacerbation rate was reduced by 25% from 1.32 a year on placebo to 0.99 a year on with fluticasone propionate (P=0.026). Health status deteriorated by 3.2 units a year on placebo and 2.0 units a year on fluticasone propionate (P=0.0043). Withdrawals because of respiratory disease not related to malignancy were higher in the placebo group (25% v 19%, P=0.034). Conclusions Fluticasone propionate 500 microgram twice daily did not affect the rate of decline in FEV(1) but did produce a small increase in FEV(1). Patients on fluticasone propionate had fewer exacerbations and a slower decline in health status. These improvements in clinical outcomes support the use of this treatment in patients with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.;Respiratory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train
302;11136260;Effect of inhaled triamcinolone on the decline in pulmonary function in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.;Background Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) results from a progressive decline in lung function, which is thought to be the consequence of airway inflammation. We hypothesized that antiinflammatory therapy with inhaled corticosteroids would slow this decline. Methods We enrolled 1116 persons with COPD whose forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) was 30 to 90 percent of the predicted value in a 10-center, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of inhaled triamcinolone acetonide administered at a dose of 600 microg twice daily. The primary outcome measure was the rate of decline in FEV1 after the administration of a bronchodilator. The secondary outcome measures included respiratory symptoms, use of health care services, and airway reactivity. In a substudy of 412 participants, we measured bone density in the lumbar spine and femur at base line and one and three years after the beginning of treatment. Results The mean duration of follow-up was 40 months. The rate of decline in the FEV1 after bronchodilator use was similar in the 559 participants in the triamcinolone group and the 557 participants in the placebo group (44.2+/-2.9 vs. 47.0+/-3.0 ml per year, P= 0.50). Members of the triamcinolone group had fewer respiratory symptoms during the course of the study (21.1 per 100 person-years vs. 28.2 per 100 person-years, P=0.005) and had fewer visits to a physician because of a respiratory illness (1.2 per 100 person-years vs. 2.1 per 100 person-years, P=0.03). Those taking triamcinolone also had lower airway reactivity in response to methacholine challenge at 9 months and 33 months (P=0.02 for both comparisons). After three years, the bone density of the lumbar spine and the femur was significantly lower in the triamcinolone group (P < or = 0.007). Conclusions Inhaled triamcinolone does not slow the rate of decline in lung function in people with COPD, but it improves airway reactivity and respiratory symptoms and decreases the use of health care services for respiratory problems. These benefits should be weighed against the potential long-term adverse effects of triamcinolone on bone mineral density.;Respiratory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train
303;11755608;Once daily oral ofloxacin in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation requiring mechanical ventilation: a randomised placebo-controlled trial.;"Background The role of antibiotics in treatment of patients with moderate exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is uncertain, but such treatment might be useful in very severe episodes. Our objective was to assess the effects of ofloxacin in patients with exacerbations of COPD who required mechanical ventilation. Methods We did a prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 93 patients with acute exacerbation of COPD who required mechanical ventilation. Patients were randomly assigned to receive oral ofloxacin 400 mg once daily (n=47) or placebo (46) for 10 days. Primary endpoints were death in hospital and need for an additional course of antibiotics, both separately and in combination. Analysis was by intention to treat. Findings Three patients dropped out of the study. Two (4%) patients receiving ofloxacin died in hospital and ten (22%) did so in the placebo group (absolute risk reduction 17.5%, 95% CI 4.3-30.7, p=0.01). Treatment with ofloxacin significantly reduced the need for additional courses of antibiotics (28.4%, 12.9-43.9, p=0.0006). The combined frequency of death in hospital and need for additional antibiotics was significantly lower in patients assigned to ofloxacin than in those receiving placebo (45.9%, 29.1-62.7, p<0.0001). The duration of mechanical ventilation and hospital stay was significantly shorter in the ofloxacin group than in the placebo group (absolute difference 4.2 days, 95% CI 2.5-5.9; and 9.6 days, 3.4-12.8, respectively). Interpretation New fluoroquinolones, such as ofloxacin, are beneficial in the treatment of COPD exacerbation requiring mechanical ventilation.";Respiratory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train
304;12379552;Effectiveness of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol combination delivered via the Diskus device in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.;This randomized controlled trial examined the benefits of combining an inhaled corticosteroid, fluticasone propionate (F), with an inhaled long-acting beta(2)-agonist, salmeterol (S), to treat the inflammatory and bronchoconstrictive components of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A total of 691 patients with COPD received the combination of F and S (FSC), S (50 mcg), F (500 mcg), or placebo twice daily via the Diskus device for 24 weeks. A significantly greater increase in predose FEV(1) at the endpoint was observed after FSC (156 ml) compared with S (107 ml, p = 0.012) and placebo (-4 ml, p < 0.0001). A significantly greater increase in 2-hour postdose FEV(1) at the endpoint was observed after treatment with FSC (261 ml) compared with F (138 ml, p < 0.001) and placebo (28 ml, p < 0.001). There were greater improvements in the Transition Dyspnea Index with FSC (2.1) compared with F (1.3, p = 0.033), S (0.9, p < 0.001), and placebo (0.4, p < 0.0001). The incidence of adverse effects (except for an increase in oral candidiasis with FSC and F) was similar among the treatment groups. We conclude that FSC improved lung function and reduced the severity of dyspnea compared with individual components and placebo.;Respiratory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train
305;12583942;Combined salmeterol and fluticasone in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a randomised controlled trial.;Background Inhaled long-acting beta2 agonists improve lung function and health status in symptomatic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), whereas inhaled corticosteroids reduce the frequency of acute episodes of symptom exacerbation and delay deterioration in health status. We postulated that a combination of these treatments would be better than each component used alone. Methods 1465 patients with COPD were recruited from outpatient departments in 25 countries. They were treated in a randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study with either 50 microg salmeterol twice daily (n=372), 500 microg fluticasone twice daily (n=374), 50 microg salmeterol and 500 microg fluticasone twice daily (n=358), or placebo (n=361) for 12 months. The primary outcome was the pretreatment forced expiratory volume in 1s (FEV1) after 12 months treatment' and after patients had abstained from all bronchodilators for at least 6h and from study medication for at least 12h. Secondary outcomes were other lung function measurements, symptoms and rescue treatment use, the number of exacerbations, patient withdrawals, and disease-specific health status. We assessed adverse events, serum cortisol concentrations, skin bruising, and electrocardiograms. Analysis was as predefined in the study protocol. Findings All active treatments improved lung function, symptoms, and health status and reduced use of rescue medication and frequency of exacerbations. Combination therapy improved pretreatment FEV1 significantly more than did placebo (treatment difference 133 mL, 95% CI 105-161, p<0.0001), salmeterol (73 mL, 46-101, p<0.0001), or fluticasone alone (95 mL, 67-122, p<0.0001). Combination treatment produced a clinically significant improvement in health status and the greatest reduction in daily symptoms. All treatments were well tolerated with no difference in the frequency of adverse events, bruising, or clinically significant falls in serum cortisol concentration. Interpretation Because inhaled long-acting beta2 agonists and corticosteroid combination treatment produces better control of symptoms and lung function, with no greater risk of side-effects than that with use of either component alone, this combination treatment should be considered for patients with COPD.;Respiratory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train
306;12670779;Bronchodilator response to formoterol Turbuhaler in patients with COPD under regular treatment with formoterol Turbuhaler.;Formoterol Turbuhaler has been suggested for as-needed use in asthmatic patients. We investigated whether regular treatment with formoterol would modify the dose-response curves to formoterol in patients with partially reversible COPD. In this randomised, double-blind, cross-over study taking place over four non-consecutive days 16 outpatients with moderate to severe COPD, who were under regular treatment with formoterol Turbuhaler (18 microg in two daily doses) from at least 4 months, inhaled a conventional dose of formoterol Turbuhaler 9 microg or placebo. Two hours later, a FEV(1) value was established, following which a dose-response curve to formoterol (4.5 microg/inhalation) or placebo was constructed using four inhalations (1+1+2)--total cumulative delivered dose of 18 microg formoterol--with the following sequences: (1) formoterol pre-treatment + formoterol 18 microg, (2) formoterol pre-treatment + placebo, (3) placebo pre-treatment + formoterol 18 microg, (4) placebo pre-treatment + placebo. Formoterol 9 microg induced significant (P < 0.0001) bronchodilation at 2 h after inhalation (best mean increase in FEV(1): 0.170 L). Afterwards, dose-dependent increases in FEV(1) occurred with formoterol (maximum mean increase from 2-h value with formoterol: 0.072 after formoterol pre-treatment, and 0.201 L after placebo pre-treatment). Both maximum values of bronchodilation after the last inhalation of formoterol were statistically different (P < 0.001) from 2-h levels. These results show that dose-dependent bronchodilatation of formoterol is maintained despite regular treatment.;Respiratory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train
307;17314337;Salmeterol and fluticasone propionate and survival in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.;"Background Long-acting beta-agonists and inhaled corticosteroids are used to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but their effect on survival is unknown. Methods We conducted a randomized, double-blind trial comparing salmeterol at a dose of 50 microg plus fluticasone propionate at a dose of 500 microg twice daily (combination regimen), administered with a single inhaler, with placebo, salmeterol alone, or fluticasone propionate alone for a period of 3 years. The primary outcome was death from any cause for the comparison between the combination regimen and placebo; the frequency of exacerbations, health status, and spirometric values were also assessed. Results Of 6112 patients in the efficacy population, 875 died within 3 years after the start of the study treatment. All-cause mortality rates were 12.6% in the combination-therapy group, 15.2% in the placebo group, 13.5% in the salmeterol group, and 16.0% in the fluticasone group. The hazard ratio for death in the combination-therapy group, as compared with the placebo group, was 0.825 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.681 to 1.002; P=0.052, adjusted for the interim analyses), corresponding to a difference of 2.6 percentage points or a reduction in the risk of death of 17.5%. The mortality rate for salmeterol alone or fluticasone propionate alone did not differ significantly from that for placebo. As compared with placebo, the combination regimen reduced the annual rate of exacerbations from 1.13 to 0.85 and improved health status and spirometric values (P<0.001 for all comparisons with placebo). There was no difference in the incidence of ocular or bone side effects. The probability of having pneumonia reported as an adverse event was higher among patients receiving medications containing fluticasone propionate (19.6% in the combination-therapy group and 18.3% in the fluticasone group) than in the placebo group (12.3%, P<0.001 for comparisons between these treatments and placebo). Conclusions The reduction in death from all causes among patients with COPD in the combination-therapy group did not reach the predetermined level of statistical significance. There were significant benefits in all other outcomes among these patients. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00268216 [ClinicalTrials.gov].).";Respiratory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train
308;17466655;Comparing COPD treatment: nebulizer, metered dose inhaler, and concomitant therapy.;Purpose Patients using albuterol and ipratropium for treating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) can use either nebulizers or metered dose inhalers. This study compared the 2 methods of delivering medication and the concomitant use of both nebulizer and inhaler, with respect to health-related quality of life, patient symptoms, and efficacy. Subjects and methods Patients over 50 years old with COPD were randomized into 3 groups: nebulizer, inhaler, or concomitant treatment. Quality of life was assessed using the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire at baseline, and at 6 and 12 weeks. Other efficacy measurements at these time-points included pre- and post-dose forced expired volume in 1 second (FEV1). Symptom scores and peak flow measurements were recorded in patient diaries. Results Of 140 patients enrolled, 126 completed at least one post-baseline assessment. At week 6, both groups using a nebulizer achieved statistically significant improvements from baseline in questionnaire symptoms, and the concomitant treatment group had clinically and statistically significant improvement in total questionnaire score. At week 12, the concomitant group still maintained significant improvement in symptom sub-scores. The 3 groups showed little change over time in peak flow or FEV1, with no significant difference among groups. Both groups using a nebulizer had significant improvement over time in diary symptom scores, although differences between groups were not significant. Conclusions Patients using combined nebulizer therapy morning and night with mid-day inhaler use had the most statistically significant improvements in quality of life indices. This concomitant regimen provides the additional symptom relief offered by a nebulizer with the convenience of an inhaler when patients are away from home.;Respiratory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train
309;17719763;Tiotropium administered by a pressurized metered dose inhaler (pMDI) and spacer produces a similar bronchodilator response as that administered by a Rotahaler in adult subjects with stable moderate-to-severe COPD.;Background Tiotropium is a new long-acting anticholinergic bronchodilator, which is recommended as first-line therapy in the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is currently available in the form of a dry powder inhaler worldwide. Some COPD patients find it difficult to generate inspiratory flow rates of up to 40 l/min, which is required for the drug to reach the airways. To overcome this, a new pMDI form has been developed for administration of tiotropium in patients with COPD. The clinical efficacy of this mode of tiotropium delivery has, so far, not been compared with the currently available dry powder inhaler (DPI) devices. Aims and objectives To compare the bronchodilator effects of a single dose of 18 mcg of tiotropium administered via a pressurized meter dose inhaler (pMDI) and spacer with the currently available DPI form through Rotahaler. Study design A randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, three-period, placebo-controlled, crossover, single-center study was conducted in 19 patients with stable COPD. Single doses of tiotropium (18 mcg) or placebo were administered on three separate study days (4-7 days apart) through a Rotahaler and pMDI with a non-static spacer (Zerostat, Cipla Ltd.). During each study visit forced expiratory volume in 1s (FEV(1)) and forced vital capacity (FVC) were measured over a period of 24 h at 11 different time points (0, 15, 30 min, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24h), using a bellows spirometer (Vitalograph) 2160, UK) while static parameters like inspiratory capacity (IC), residual volume (RV), intrathoracic gas volume (ITGV) and total lung capacity (TLC) were measured by bodyplethysmography (Jaeger Masterscreen, Germany) at 0 min, 3, 8 and 24 h. Results Tiotropium administered through both pMDI (and spacer) and DPI showed significantly better mean FEV(1) and mean FVC differences from baseline, in terms of mean maximum change and area under curve over a period of 24 h (AUC(0-24 h)), as compared to placebo. The mean IC and trough FEV(1) values also improved significantly with tiotropium administered through both the devices as compared to placebo. For all these parameters, there was no difference in the efficacy between pMDI and DPI. There was also no significant difference between the time to onset, time to maximum response and duration of response between tiotropium administered through both the study devices. On the other hand, there was no significant difference in RV, ITGV and TLC by a single dose of tiotopium delivered through either of the devices when compared with placebo over a period of 24 h. Conclusion This is the first study to demonstrate that tiotropium administered by pMDI and spacer shows a superior time-dependent bronchodilator response when compared to placebo, and that this therapeutic efficacy is similar to tiotropium administered by DPI. We recommend the use of tiotropium administered through a pMDI and spacer to those COPD patients who prefer to use the pMDI device, and especially in those who cannot generate sufficient inspiratory flows required for dry powder inhaler devices.;Respiratory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train

COPD patients (n = 202; 86% male; mean age: 61 years) were randomized to receive tiotropium 1.25 microg, 2.5 microg, 5 microg, 10 microg, or 20 microg Respimat SMI (a novel, propellant-free device); tiotropium 18 microg HandiHaler; placebo Respimat; or placebo HandiHaler for 3 weeks. The primary endpoint was trough FEV1 on Day 21. Other assessments included FVC, PEFR, rescue medication use, safety, and pharmacokinetics. In general, all active treatments improved the primary and secondary endpoints on Day 21 (steady state) compared with placebo. Tiotropium 5 microg Respimat, 20 microg Respimat, and tiotropium 18 microg HandiHaler were statistically significantly higher than placebo for the primary endpoint (mean change in trough FEV1 was 150 mL (both Respimat doses) versus 20 mL (placebo Respimat); p < 0.05; and 230 mL (HandiHaler) versus -90 mL (placebo HandiHaler); p < or = 0.001). The urinary excretion (up to 2 hours post-dose) of tiotropium 5-10 microg Respimat was comparable with tiotropium 18 microg HandiHaler; the overall incidence of adverse events was comparable across treatment groups.

A next-generation multidose dry powder inhaler will be used for the delivery of aclidinium bromide. Objectives To quantify whole lung deposition and regional lung deposition of aclidinium delivered by a multidose dry powder inhaler (Genuair) in healthy subjects. Methods A single dose (200 microg) of aclidinium bromide, radiolabelled with (99m)Tc, was administered from the multidose dry powder inhaler at a targeted peak inspiratory flow rate (PIFR) of 90 litres/min in 12 healthy males (18-63 years). Gamma scintigraphy was used to quantify drug deposition in the lungs and oropharynx, as well as amounts retained in the inhaler and exhaled. The quantities of drug deposited in 6 concentric regions within the lungs were also determined. Results The mean (+/- SD) PIFR was 79.0 +/- 9.4 litres/min. The mean (+/- SD) percentages of the metered dose deposited in the whole lung and oropharynx were 30.1 +/- 7.3 and 54.7 +/- 7.2%, respectively. Deposition of aclidinium occurred in all 6 lung zones, but was highest in the most central zone. Conclusions These results demonstrated that the multidose dry powder inhaler delivered aclidinium efficiently to the lungs. The whole lung deposition seen in this study is an indication of the likely whole lung deposition in COPD patients who inhale with similar PIFRs; however, further studies in patients are required to confirm this.";Respiratory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Test
314;19465142;Bronchodilator effects of indacaterol and formoterol in patients with COPD.;"Background Resting inspiratory capacity (IC) reflects static hyperinflation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This study compared the effects of formoterol and indacaterol, a novel once-daily ultra-long-acting beta(2)-agonist (or ultra-LABA), on resting IC and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)). Methods Thirty patients with COPD (mean FEV(1)/FVC 0.49, mean FEV(1) 56% predicted) each inhaled three treatments (two in randomized sequence followed by open-label formoterol) on separate study days: a single dose of indacaterol 300 microg, matching placebo, and two doses of formoterol 12 microg 12 h apart. Results Indacaterol and formoterol increased FEV(1) and IC at all time points relative to placebo (p<0.001). Peak effects on FEV(1) were similar, while indacaterol had a greater effect on peak IC (31% vs 23% from pre-dose; p=0.034). Indacaterol had a greater effect than formoterol on FEV(1) at 8 h (1.47 vs 1.39 L; p=0.014) and 24 h (1.44 vs 1.35 L; p=0.003), and on IC from 4 to 24 h (differences of 0.13-0.19 L; p<0.05). At 24 h, indacaterol and formoterol increased FEV(1) by 17.7% and 7.5%, respectively, from pre-dose. Conclusions This study discriminated between the effects on IC and FEV(1) of once daily indacaterol and twice daily formoterol. The greater effect of indacaterol on IC may translate into improved long-term clinical outcomes.";Respiratory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train

Combining these medications may provide additional benefits. Objectives To assess the efficacy and tolerability of budesonide/formoterol added to tiotropium in patients eligible for inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting beta(2)-agonist combination therapy. Methods In this 12-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter study, after a 2-week run-in, 660 subjects (75% male; mean age, 62 yr; FEV(1), 1.1 L; 38% predicted normal), 40 years of age or older, received tiotropium (18 microg once daily) plus either budesonide/formoterol (320/9 microg) (n = 329) or placebo (n = 331) twice daily. Measurements and main results Clinic predose (primary outcome) and postdose FEV(1), predose and postdose forced vital capacity and inspiratory capacity, and health status were measured. Other outcomes included daily measurements taken at home (pre- and postdose morning FEV(1) and peak expiratory flow, morning symptoms and activities, and morning reliever use), severe exacerbations, and tolerability. Over the treatment period, budesonide/formoterol plus tiotropium significantly increased predose FEV(1) by 6% (65 ml) and postdose by 11% (123 and 131 ml at 5 and 60 min postdose, respectively) versus tiotropium alone (both P < 0.001). Other outcomes all significantly improved with budesonide/formoterol plus tiotropium versus tiotropium alone. The number of severe exacerbations decreased by 62% (rate ratio, 0.38; 95% confidence interval, 0.25-0.57; P < 0.001). Both treatments were well tolerated. Conclusions In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, budesonide/formoterol added to tiotropium versus tiotropium alone provides rapid and sustained improvements in lung function, health status, morning symptoms and activities, and reduces severe exacerbations.

The primary aim of this study was to assess the inspiratory flow characteristics through Genuair in patients with moderate or severe COPD. Using a three-period cross-over design, 48 patients were randomised to inhale placebo powder through Genuair, HandiHaler A (slow, deep inhalation as per manufacturer's instructions) or HandiHaler B (fast, forceful inhalation). Three measurements of peak inspiratory flow (PIF), 10min apart, were recorded for each method of administration. The highest and average PIFs for the three attempts (mean+/-standard deviation) generated through the Genuair inhaler were 97.7+/-15.7 and 92.0+/-15.4L/min, respectively. Furthermore, 97% of inhalations with the Genuair inhaler were successful (activation of trigger threshold mechanism) and optimal (PIF> or =45L/min). The highest and average PIFs generated through HandiHaler A and B were significantly lower than with the Genuair inhaler. In conclusion, patients with moderate or severe COPD were able to generate sufficient inspiratory airflow through the Genuair inhaler to reliably inhale the full dose and reset the inhaler.;Respiratory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train

This 12-week, double-blind study compared the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of indacaterol to that of placebo in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD. Methods Efficacy variables included 24-h trough FEV1 (mean of 23 h 10 min and 23 h 45 min post-dose) at Week 12 (primary endpoint) and after Day 1, and the percentage of COPD days with poor control (i.e., worsening symptoms). Safety was assessed by adverse events (AEs), mean serum potassium and blood glucose, QTc (Fridericia), and vital signs. Results Patients were randomised (n = 416, mean age 63 years) to receive either indacaterol 150 microg o.d. (n = 211) or placebo (n = 205) via a single-dose dry-powder inhaler; 87.5% completed the study. Trough FEV1 (LSM +/- SEM) at Week 12 was 1.48 +/- 0.018 L for indacaterol and 1.35 +/- 0.019 L for placebo, a clinically relevant difference of 130 +/- 24 mL (p < 0.001). Trough FEV1 after one dose was significantly higher with indacaterol than placebo (p < 0.001). Indacaterol demonstrated significantly higher peak FEV1 than placebo, both on Day 1 and at Week 12, with indacaterol-placebo differences (LSM +/- SEM) of 190 +/- 28 (p < 0.001) and 160 +/- 28 mL (p < 0.001), respectively. Standardised AUC measurements for FEV1 (between 5 min and 4 h, 5 min and 1 h, and 1 and 4 h post-dose) at Week 12 were all significantly greater with indacaterol than placebo (p < 0.001), with LSM (+/- SEM) differences of 170 +/- 24, 180 +/- 24, and 170 +/- 24 mL, respectively. Indacaterol significantly reduced the percentage of days of poor control versus placebo by 22.5% (p < 0.001) and was also associated with significantly reduced use of rescue medication (p < 0.001). The overall rates of AEs were comparable between the groups (indacaterol 49.3%, placebo 46.8%), with the most common AEs being COPD worsening (indacaterol 8.5%, placebo 12.2%) and cough (indacaterol 6.2%, placebo 7.3%). One patient died in the placebo group. Serum potassium and blood glucose levels did not differ significantly between the two groups, and no patient had QTc >500 ms.

Objectives To demonstrate greater efficacy of indacaterol versus placebo on FEV(1) at 24 hours post dose (trough) after 12 weeks, to compare efficacy with placebo and tiotropium, and to evaluate safety and tolerability over 26 weeks. Measurements Patients with moderate-to-severe COPD were randomized to double-blind indacaterol 150 or 300 microg or placebo, or open-label tiotropium 18 microg, all once daily, for 26 weeks. The primary efficacy outcome was trough FEV(1) at 12 weeks. Additional analyses (not adjusted for multiplicity) included transition dyspnea index (TDI), health status (St George's Respiratory Questionnaire [SGRQ]), and exacerbations. Serum potassium, blood glucose, and QTc interval were measured. Results A total of 1,683 patients (age, 63.3 yr; post-bronchodilator FEV(1), 56% predicted; FEV(1)/FVC, 0.53) were randomized to the four treatment arms. Trough FEV(1) at Week 12 increased versus placebo by 180 ml with both indacaterol doses and by 140 ml with tiotropium (all P < 0.001 vs. placebo). At Week 26, for indacaterol 150/300 microg, respectively, versus placebo, TDI increased (1.00/1.18, P < 0.001) and SGRQ total score decreased (-3.3/-2.4, P < 0.01); corresponding results with tiotropium were 0.87 (P < 0.001) for TDI and (-1.0, P = not significant) for SGRQ total score.

320;20522841;Efficacy of a new once-daily long-acting inhaled beta2-agonist indacaterol versus twice-daily formoterol in COPD.;Background Indacaterol is a long-acting inhaled beta(2)-agonist (LABA) for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In previous studies, indacaterol provided 24 h bronchodilation on once-daily dosing with a fast onset of action. This study compared the efficacy and safety of indacaterol with the twice-daily LABA formoterol and placebo over 1 year. Methods Patients with moderate to severe COPD were randomised to receive once-daily indacaterol 300 microg (n=437) or 600 microg (n=428), twice-daily formoterol 12 microg (n=435) or placebo (n=432) for 52 weeks in a double-blind double-dummy parallel group study. The primary efficacy variable was forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) measured 24 h postdose after 12 weeks (indacaterol vs placebo). Other outcomes included dyspnoea (transition dyspnoea index, TDI), use of as-needed salbutamol, symptom-based measures recorded on diary cards, exacerbations, health status (St George's Respiratory Questionnaire), BODE index (body mass index, obstruction, dyspnoea, exercise), safety and tolerability. Results Indacaterol increased 24 h postdose FEV(1) after 12 weeks by 170 ml (both doses) versus placebo and by 100 ml versus formoterol (all p<0.001). These significant differences were maintained at 52 weeks. Symptomatic outcomes were improved compared with placebo with all active treatments, and indacaterol was more effective than formoterol in improving TDI score and reducing the need for as-needed salbutamol. Indacaterol was well tolerated and had a good overall safety profile, including minimal impact on QTc interval and systemic beta(2)-mediated events. Conclusions Once-daily indacaterol is an effective 24 h bronchodilator that improves symptoms and health status and confers clinical improvements over a twice-daily 12 h LABA as a treatment for patients with moderate to severe COPD.

This study evaluated the 24-h bronchodilatory efficacy and safety of indacaterol in Japanese patients with COPD. Methods This Phase-II, randomised, placebo-controlled, crossover study comprised four double-blind, single-dose treatment periods (washout between periods: 14-28 days). Japanese patients aged 40-75 years with moderate-to-severe COPD were randomised to receive single doses of indacaterol (150, 300, or 600 microg) or placebo via a single-dose dry-powder inhaler.

We investigated whether the anticholinergic drug tiotropium is superior to the β(2)-agonist salmeterol in preventing exacerbations of COPD. Methods In a 1-year, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group trial, we compared the effect of treatment with 18 μg of tiotropium once daily with that of 50 μg of salmeterol twice daily on the incidence of moderate or severe exacerbations in patients with moderate-to-very-severe COPD and a history of exacerbations in the preceding year. Results A total of 7376 patients were randomly assigned to and treated with tiotropium (3707 patients) or salmeterol (3669 patients). Tiotropium, as compared with salmeterol, increased the time to the first exacerbation (187 days vs. 145 days), with a 17% reduction in risk (hazard ratio, 0.83; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.77 to 0.90; P<0.001). Tiotropium also increased the time to the first severe exacerbation (hazard ratio, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.61 to 0.85; P<0.001), reduced the annual number of moderate or severe exacerbations (0.64 vs. 0.72; rate ratio, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.83 to 0.96; P=0.002), and reduced the annual number of severe exacerbations (0.09 vs. 0.13; rate ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.66 to 0.82; P<0.001). Overall, the incidence of serious adverse events and of adverse events leading to the discontinuation of treatment was similar in the two study groups. There were 64 deaths (1.7%) in the tiotropium group and 78 (2.1%) in the salmeterol group. Conclusions These results show that, in patients with moderate-to-very-severe COPD, tiotropium is more effective than salmeterol in preventing exacerbations.

328;21622587;Blinded 12-week comparison of once-daily indacaterol and tiotropium in COPD.;"Two, once daily (q.d.) inhaled bronchodilators are available for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): the β(2)-agonist indacaterol and the anticholinergic tiotropium. This blinded study compared the efficacy of these two agents and assessed their safety and tolerability. Patients with moderate-to-severe COPD were randomised to treatment with indacaterol 150 μg q.d. (n=797) or tiotropium 18 μg q.d. (n=801) for 12 weeks. After 12 weeks, the two treatments had similar overall effects on ""trough"" (24 h post-dose) forced expiratory volume in 1 s. Indacaterol-treated patients had greater improvements in transition dyspnoea index (TDI) total score (least squares means 2.01 versus 1.43; p<0.001) and St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score (least squares means 37.1 versus 39.2; p<0.001; raw mean change from baseline -5.1 versus -3.0), and were significantly more likely to achieve clinically relevant improvements in these end-points (indacaterol versus tiotropium odds ratios of 1.49 for TDI and 1.43 for SGRQ, both p<0.001). Adverse events were recorded for 39.7% and 37.2% of patients in the indacaterol and tiotropium treatment groups, respectively. The most frequent adverse events were COPD worsening, cough and nasopharyngitis. Both bronchodilators demonstrated spirometric efficacy. The two treatments were well tolerated with similar adverse event profiles. Compared with tiotropium, indacaterol provided significantly greater improvements in clinical outcomes.";Respiratory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train
329;21700602;Tiotropium improves walking endurance in COPD.;The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of a 3-week treatment with tiotropium on walking capacity in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). After familiarisation with study procedures, 36 patients were randomised to receive tiotropium 18 μg once daily or a matching placebo in a double-blind, parallel-group study. Pre- (trough) and 2-h post-dose pulmonary function was measured. An endurance shuttle walk was then completed. The same procedures were repeated after 3 weeks of treatment. Ventilatory parameters were monitored during exercise. At 3 weeks, tiotropium significantly improved walking endurance time in comparison with placebo, with a mean±sd between-group difference of 128±141 s (p=0.017). At 3 weeks, trough values for forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) and forced vital capacity (FVC) were significantly improved with tiotropium in comparison with placebo. The post-dose response to tiotropium was statistically superior to placebo after the first dose and after 3 weeks of treatment for FEV(1), FVC and inspiratory capacity. Ventilation and tidal volume at the end of walking were significantly improved with tiotropium. 3 weeks of tiotropium resulted in a greater walking endurance in patients with COPD. Improvements in FEV(1), maximal ventilation and tidal volume may contribute to this enhanced exercise capacity.;Respiratory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train
330;21793716;Effect of indacaterol on dynamic lung hyperinflation and breathlessness in hyperinflated patients with COPD.;"Indacaterol is a novel, inhaled once-daily ultra long-acting β2-agonist for the treatment of COPD. This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-period crossover study evaluated the effect of two-week treatment with indacaterol 300 μg on peak and isotime exercise inspiratory capacity (IC) in patients with COPD. Patients (40-80 years) with post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) < 70%, percent predicted FEV1 ≥ 40% and ≤ 80%, smoking history ≥ 20 pack-years and functional residual capacity > 120% of predicted normal were randomised to receive indacaterol 300 μg or placebo once-daily via a single-dose dry powder inhaler. Following 14 days of treatment, IC at peak and isotime during constant-load (80% of maximum workload) cycle ergometry was analysed using linear mixed-effects models. Safety and tolerability were also monitored. Twenty-seven patients (67% male; mean age, 61.3 years) were randomised; 24 completed the study. On Day 14, indacaterol showed statistically significant improvements over placebo in peak (317 mL [95% CI: 118-517]; p < 0.01) and isotime IC (268 mL [95% CI: 104-432]; p < 0.01). Statistically significant improvements were observed with indacaterol versus placebo on Day 14 for the following secondary endpoints: resting IC, trough FEV1, dyspnoea (BDI/TDI and Borg CR10 scale at isotime) and exercise endurance time. Indacaterol was well tolerated, with no serious adverse events or deaths. In conclusion, indacaterol 300 μg administered once-daily showed a clinically relevant increase in IC after 14 days of treatment, reflecting a reduction in dynamic hyperinflation.";Respiratory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train
331;21828231;Fluticasone furoate demonstrates efficacy in patients with asthma symptomatic on medium doses of inhaled corticosteroid therapy: an 8-week, randomised, placebo-controlled trial.;"Background Fluticasone furoate (FF) is a novel inhaled corticosteroid with 24 h activity. FF is being developed as a once-daily treatment in combination with the long-acting β(2) agonist vilanterol trifenatate for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Objectives To determine the optimal dose(s) of FF for treating patients with asthma. Methods An 8-week multicentre, randomised, double-blind study. 627 patients with persistent moderate-to-severe asthma, symptomatic on medium-dose inhaled corticosteroid therapy, were randomised to placebo, FF 200, 400, 600 or 800 μg (once daily in the evening using a novel dry powder inhaler), or fluticasone propionate 500 μg twice daily (via Diskus™/Accuhaler™). The primary efficacy measure was mean change from baseline in pre-dose evening forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1)). Other endpoints included morning and evening peak expiratory flow, and rescue/symptom-free 24 h periods. Results Each dose was significantly superior to placebo for the primary endpoint (p<0.001) with efficacy at least similar to that reported with fluticasone propionate. There was no dose-response relationship across the FF doses studied. Peak expiratory flow improved in all groups (p<0.001 vs placebo), and there were significant treatment effects on rescue/symptom-free 24 h periods with all active treatments. FF was generally well tolerated. The incidence of oral candidiasis was higher with FF 800 μg than placebo; pharmacokinetic and 24 h urinary cortisol analyses confirmed a higher systemic exposure of FF at this highest dose level. Conclusions FF doses <800 μg have a favourable therapeutic index. The absence of an efficacy dose response suggests that 200 μg is an appropriate dose in patients with moderate persistent asthma.

332;21848706;Roflumilast in Asian patients with COPD: A randomized placebo-controlled trial.;"Background and objective Roflumilast, an oral, selective phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor, has been shown to reduce exacerbations and improve pulmonary function in patients with COPD. This study examined the efficacy, safety and tolerability of roflumilast in Asian patients with COPD. Methods Patients with COPD were randomized 1:1 to enter a 12-week treatment period and receive either oral roflumilast, 500 µg once daily, or placebo, following a single-blind, 4-week baseline period in which all patients received placebo. The primary end point was mean change in FEV₁ from baseline to each postrandomization visit during the treatment period. Other spirometric lung function measurements were evaluated as secondary end points. COPD exacerbations were monitored. Safety was assessed from clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, physical examination (including electrocardiogram) and monitoring of adverse events (AEs). Results Of 551 patients recruited, 410 were randomized and received at least one dose of study medication (roflumilast, n = 203; placebo, n = 207). Superiority of roflumilast over placebo was demonstrated by a statistically significant difference in postbronchodilator FEV₁ (79 mL, P < 0.0001). Other spirometry end points, including prebronchodilator FEV₁, pre-and postbronchodilator FEV₆, forced vital capacity and peak expiratory flow significantly favoured roflumilast over placebo. AEs were more common with roflumilast than with placebo, but were comparable with those reported in previous studies. Conclusions Roflumilast, 500 µg once daily, improves pulmonary function in Asian patients with COPD. The safety and tolerability of roflumilast in this population was similar to that in a Caucasian population.";Respiratory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train
333;21975275;Comparison of tiotropium plus fluticasone propionate/salmeterol with tiotropium in COPD: a randomized controlled study.;"Background The combination of tiotropium and fluticasone propionate/salmeterol (FSC) is commonly used to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but no study had evaluated the effectiveness of tiotropium plus FSC with 250 μg of fluticasone propionate. Our aim was to assess whether tiotropium (18 μg once daily) plus FSC (250/50 μg twice daily) provides better clinical outcomes compared to tiotropium monotherapy. Methods In this 24-week, randomized, open label, multicenter two-arm parallel study, 479 patients received tiotropium plus FSC (n = 237) or tiotropium alone (n = 242). Results After 24 weeks of treatment, the triple-inhaled treatment group had a significant improvement in pre-bronchodilator FEV(1) (L) compared to the tiotropium-only group (0.090 L vs. 0.038 L; P = 0.005). Regarding health-related quality of life, the mean change in total score on the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire for COPD patients (SGRQ-C) was -6.6 points in the tiotropium plus FSC group, but -1.5 points in the tiotropium-only group (P = 0.001). In the subgroup of GOLD stage II patients with COPD, treatment with tiotropium plus FSC also improved FEV(1) compared to tiotropium alone (0.088 L vs. 0.030 L; P = 0.011) and improved the total SGRQ-C score than tiotropium alone (-4.5 points vs. -1.0 points, respectively). This triple-inhaled treatment approach did not induce more adverse events, such as pneumonia. Conclusion Over the course of 24 weeks, FSC (250/50 μg twice daily) added to tiotropium provided greater improvement in lung function and quality of life in patients with COPD (FEV(1) ≤ 65%) than tiotropium alone.";Respiratory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train

Objective This study aimed to evaluate the onset of effect of single-dose formoterol 9 μg versus single-dose salmeterol 50 μg in patients with moderate COPD. Methods In this multicentre, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, three-way single-dose crossover study, patients ≥40 years of age with moderate COPD were randomized to single-dose formoterol 9 μg via Turbuhaler® plus placebo via Diskus®, single-dose salmeterol 50 μg via Diskus® plus placebo via Turbuhaler® or placebo via Turbuhaler® and Diskus® (washout period 2-7 days). Terbutaline 0.5 mg/actuation via Turbuhaler® was used as reliever medication throughout. The primary endpoint was forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV₁) at 5 minutes post-dose. Secondary endpoints included proportion of patients achieving ≥12% increase in FEV₁ at 5 minutes post-dose. Results 109 patients were randomized, and 108 completed the study. The increase in FEV₁ 5 minutes post-dose versus pre-dose was 7.2% for formoterol, 4.1% for salmeterol and 0.7% for placebo, and significantly greater for formoterol versus salmeterol (ratio of treatment effects: 1.030; 95% CI 1.008, 1.052; p = 0.009), for formoterol versus placebo (1.064, 95% CI 1.041, 1.087; p < 0.001) and for salmeterol versus placebo (1.033, 95% CI 1.011, 1.056; p = 0.003). The proportions of patients with ≥12% increase in FEV₁ 5 minutes post-dose were 23.1%, 9.2% and 6.4% for formoterol, salmeterol and placebo, respectively; this was statistically significantly larger after formoterol than salmeterol (p = 0.008) or placebo (p < 0.001). All treatments were well tolerated. Conclusion In COPD patients, formoterol 9 μg has an onset of bronchodilatory effect that is more rapid than salmeterol 50 μg based on FEV₁ at 5 minutes post-dose.

Methods This multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial had a 26-week treatment period and a 26-week safety extension. Subjects (n = 1055; ≥40 years) were current or ex- smokers randomized to twice-daily treatment with inhaled MF/F 400/10 μg, MF/F 200/10 μg, MF 400 μg, F 10 μg, or placebo. The coprimary endpoints of the trial were mean changes from baseline in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)) over 0-12 hours (AUC(0-12) FEV(1)) with MF/F versus MF, and in morning predose FEV(1) with MF/F versus F. Key secondary endpoints were quality of life (Saint George's Respiratory Questionnaire [SGRQ]), symptom-free nights, and partly stable COPD at 26 weeks, as well as time to first COPD exacerbation. Results Significant improvements in FEV(1) AUC(0-12) occurred at endpoint with MF/F 400/10 and MF/F 200/10 versus MF 400 (P ≤ 0.007). Significant bronchodilation occurred in 5 minutes with MF/F, and serial spirometry demonstrated sustained FEV(1) improvements with MF/F over the treatment period. Significant improvements in morning predose FEV(1) occurred with both MF/F doses, and these effects were further investigated by excluding results for subjects whose morning FEV(1) data were collected >2 days after the last dose of study treatment. Improvements in SGRQ total scores surpassed the minimum clinically important difference of at least 4 units with MF/F 400/10. MF/F 400/10 significantly reduced the time-to-first COPD exacerbation. Similar proportions of subjects in all five treatment groups reported treatment-emergent adverse events. Rates of pneumonia were low (≤1.0%) across treatment groups. Conclusion MF/F 400/10 μg twice daily was shown to be an effective therapy for patients with moderate to very severe COPD, and both MF/F 400/10 μg twice daily and MF/F 200/10 μg twice daily were well tolerated.";Respiratory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train

The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of repeat dosing of UMEC and VI in combination once daily for 28 days in patients with COPD. Methods This was a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study. Patients aged ≥40 years with post-bronchodilator FEV₁ ≤80% of predicted normal values and FEV₁/FVC ratio ≤0.70, and a smoking history of ≥10 pack-years, were randomized 4:1 to once-daily UMEC/VI (500/25 mcg; n = 42) or placebo (n = 9). Results UMEC/VI was non-inferior to placebo in weighted mean pulse rate over 0-6 h at Day 28 (primary endpoint: difference of -0.5 bpm, 95% CI: -5.5 to 4.5). There was no evidence of a difference between UMEC/VI compared with placebo in blood pressure, minimum and maximum pulse rate, or QTcF assessments. Adverse events (AEs) were reported by 11 (26%) patients in the UMEC/VI group and one (11%) patient in the placebo group. No serious AEs were reported. Both UMEC and VI showed rapid absorption (median t(max) ∼6 min for both drugs) with no evidence of accumulation for AUC or C(max) on Day 28 compared with Day 1 for UMEC or VI. There was no correlation between individual steady-state C(max) and pulse rate on Day 28. Change from baseline in trough FEV₁ on Day 29 showed numerically greater improvements with UMEC/VI compared with placebo.

338;23083839;Effect of an additional dose of indacaterol in COPD patients under regular treatment with indacaterol.;Aim In this randomized, double-blind, crossover study, we explored the acute effects on respiratory function and safety of an additional dose of indacaterol 150 μg in stable COPD patients regularly treated with a conventional dose of indacaterol 150 μg. Methods On two non-consecutive days, patients inhaled indacaterol 150 μg. After 180 min, they inhaled an additional dose of indacaterol 150 μg or placebo. Lung function, oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry (SpO(2)) and heart rate were measured before the first drug administration and up to 360 min thereafter. Results In both treatment groups, indacaterol induced a significant (P < 0.05) bronchodilation during all the study time. The difference between the FEV(1) AUCs(0-180 min) was not statistically significant (P = 0.971). On the contrary, the difference between the FEV(1) AUCs(180-360 min) was significant (P < 0.0001). However, only 8 out of 20 patients showed a further increase of at least 100 ml from the peak obtained after the first administration of indacaterol 150 μg with the second dose of 150 μg. Indacaterol 150 μg induced a modest but significant decrease in SpO(2) up to 60 min and a second dose of indacaterol 150 μg significantly decreased the SpO(2) mean value up to 360 min. Conclusion This study suggests that it is reasonable and safe to increase the dose of indacaterol in those stable COPD patients who are under regular therapy with indacaterol 150 μg from which they do not draw the maximum benefit because they are unable to perceive bronchodilation. However, only a minority of patients seem to benefit from this dose escalation, at least in terms of spirometric improvement.;Respiratory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train
339;23161645;TNFα antagonists for acute exacerbations of COPD: a randomised double-blind controlled trial.;Background The purpose of this randomised double-blind double-dummy placebo-controlled trial was to investigate whether etanercept, a tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα) antagonist, would provide more effective anti-inflammatory treatment for acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) than prednisone. Methods We enrolled 81 patients with acute exacerbations of COPD and randomly assigned them to treatment with either 40 mg oral prednisone given daily for 10 days or to 50 mg etanercept given subcutaneously at randomisation and 1 week later. Both groups received levofloxacin for 10 days plus inhaled bronchodilators. The primary endpoint was the change in the patient's forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) 14 days after randomisation. Secondary endpoints included 90-day treatment failure rates and dyspnoea and quality of life. Results At 14 days the mean±SE change in FEV(1) from baseline was 20.1±5.0% and 15.2±5.7% for the prednisone and etanercept groups, respectively. The mean between-treatment difference was 4.9% (95% CI -10.3% to 20.2%), p=0.52. Rates of treatment failure at 90 days were similar in the prednisone and etanercept groups (32% vs 40%, p=0.44), as were measures of dyspnoea and quality of life. Subgroup analysis revealed that patients with serum eosinophils >2% at exacerbation tended to experience fewer treatment failures if treated with prednisone compared with etanercept (22% vs 50%, p=0.08). Conclusions Etanercept was not more effective than prednisone for treatment of acute exacerbations of COPD. Efficacy of prednisone was most apparent in patients who presented with serum eosinophils >2%. Clinical trials gov number NCT 00789997.;Respiratory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train

However, the dose of inhaled corticosteroid to use in a once-daily combination is unknown. We compared two strengths of fluticasone furoate (FF) plus vilanterol (VI), the same strengths of the individual components, and placebo. Methods Multicentre, randomised, 24-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in stable, moderate-to-severe COPD subjects (N = 1224). Subjects were randomised to FF/VI (200/25 μg; 100/25 μg), FF (200 μg; 100 μg), VI 25 μg, or placebo, once daily in the morning. Co-primary efficacy endpoints; 0-4 h weighted mean (wm) FEV(1) on day 168, and change from baseline in trough (23-24 h post-dose) FEV(1) on day 169. The primary safety objective was adverse events (AEs). Results There was a statistically significant (p < 0.001) increase in wm FEV(1) (209 ml) and trough FEV(1) (131 ml) for FF/VI 200/25 μg vs. placebo; similar changes were seen for FF/VI 100/25 μg vs. placebo. Whereas the difference between FF/VI 200/25 μg and VI 25 μg in change from baseline trough FEV(1) (32 ml) was not statistically significant (p = 0.224), the difference between FF/VI 200/25 μg and FF 200 μg for wm FEV(1) (168 ml) was significantly different (p < 0.001). VI 25 μg significantly improved wm and trough FEV(1) vs. placebo (185 ml and 100 ml, [corrected] respectively). No increase was seen in on-treatment AEs or serious AEs (SAEs), with active therapy vs. placebo. Conclusions FF/VI provides rapid and significant sustained improvement in FEV(1) in subjects with moderate-to-severe COPD, which was not influenced by the dose of FF.

This study aimed to assess whether concomitant treatment with sildenafil would enhance the results of pulmonary rehabilitation in patients with COPD and increased pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP). In this double-blind, randomised controlled trial patients received 20 mg sildenafil or placebo three times daily and underwent pulmonary rehabilitation for 3 months. The primary end-point was the gain in the cycle endurance time at a constant work-rate. Secondary end-points included performance in the incremental exercise test, 6-min walk distance and quality of life. 63 patients with severe COPD and moderately increased PAP were randomised. Cycle endurance time increased by 149 s (95% CI 26-518 s) in the sildenafil group and by 169 s (95% CI 0-768 s) in the placebo group (median change difference -7 s, 95% CI -540-244 s; p=0.77). Gains in the incremental exercise test, 6-min walk distance and quality of life at the end of the study did not differ between groups. Measurements of arterial oxygenation and adverse events were similar in both groups. In patients with severe COPD and moderately increased PAP, concomitant treatment with sildenafil does not improve the results of pulmonary rehabilitation in exercise tolerance.";Respiratory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train
343;23490225;Chronic treatment with indacaterol and airway response to salbutamol in stable COPD.;"Tolerance to both the bronchoprotective effect, and, to a lesser extent, the bronchodilator activity, occurs with all inhaled β2-agonists. Assumed the importance of this topic and the lack of a clinical evaluation specifically designed to assess the impact of chronic administration of indacaterol on the response to salbutamol, we sought to compare the effect of 4-week treatment with indacaterol 150 μg once-daily versus formoterol 12 μg twice-daily on the dose-response curve to inhaled salbutamol (total cumulative dose of 800 μg) in a non-double-blinded, crossover, randomised, and controlled pilot trial that enrolled 20 outpatients with moderate to severe COPD. At the end of 4-week treatments, there was not a statistically significant difference between the two trough FEV1 (p = 0.16), and both indacaterol and formoterol were able to produce a significant (p < 0.001) increase in FEV1 mean differences (L) = indacaterol 0.15 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12-0.18); formoterol 0.10, (95% CI 0.08-0.12) 2 h after their inhalation. Salbutamol elicited an evident dose-dependent increase in FEV1 and this occurred also after regular treatment with indacaterol and formoterol with a further mean maximum increase of 0.10L (95% CI 0.05-0.14) and 0.05L (95% CI 0.02-0.08), respectively. The differences between indacaterol and formoterol in FEV1 increases after salbutamol were never statistically significant. The results of this study support the use of salbutamol as rescue medication for rapid relief of bronchospasm in patients suffering from COPD, even when they are under regular treatment with indacaterol.";Respiratory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train
344;23525511;Comparison of the systemic bioavailability of mometasone furoate after oral inhalation from a mometasone furoate/formoterol fumarate metered-dose inhaler versus a mometasone furoate dry-powder inhaler in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.;"Background Coadministration of mometasone furoate (MF) and formoterol fumarate (F) produces additive effects for improving symptoms and lung function and reduces exacerbations in patients with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The present study assessed the relative systemic exposure to MF and characterized the pharmacokinetics of MF and formoterol in patients with COPD. Methods This was a single-center, randomized, open-label, multiple-dose, three-period, three-treatment crossover study. The following three treatments were self-administered by patients (n = 14) with moderate-to-severe COPD: MF 400 μg/F 10 μg via a metered-dose inhaler (MF/F MDI; DULERA(®)/ZENHALE(®)) without a spacer device, MF/F MDI with a spacer, or MF 400 μg via a dry-powder inhaler (DPI; ASMANEX(®) TWISTHALER(®)) twice daily for 5 days. Plasma samples for MF and formoterol assay were obtained predose and at prespecified time points after the last (morning) dose on day 5 of each period of the crossover. The geometric mean ratio (GMR) as a percent and the corresponding 90% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for treatment comparisons. Results Systemic MF exposure was lower (GMR 77%; 90% CI 58, 102) following administration by MF/F MDI compared to MF DPI. Additionally, least squares geometric mean systemic exposures of MF and formoterol were lower (GMR 72%; 90% CI 61, 84) and (GMR 62%; 90% CI 52, 74), respectively, following administration by MF/F MDI in conjunction with a spacer compared to MF/F MDI without a spacer. MF/F MDI had a similar adverse experience profile as that seen with MF DPI. All adverse experiences were either mild or moderate in severity; no serious adverse experience was reported. Conclusion Systemic MF exposures were lower following administration by MF/F MDI compared with MF DPI. Additionally, systemic MF and formoterol exposures were lower following administration by MF/F MDI with a spacer versus without a spacer. The magnitude of these differences with respect to systemic exposure was not clinically relevant.";Respiratory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train

Methods In this randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, phase III study (NCT01069289), patients with moderate to severe COPD for ≥2 years received either budesonide/formoterol 160/4.5 μg two inhalations twice daily via Turbuhaler® or formoterol 4.5 μg two inhalations twice daily via Turbuhaler® for 12 weeks. Salbutamol was available as reliever medication. Primary outcome variable: change from baseline to average during treatment in pre-dose forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1 ). Results One thousand two hundred ninety-three patients were randomized (budesonide/formoterol n = 636; formoterol n = 657). Both budesonide/formoterol and formoterol increased pre-dose FEV1 versus baseline (improvements of 4.6% and 1.5% over baseline, respectively), with the increase from baseline being significantly greater with budesonide/formoterol versus formoterol (budesonide/formoterol:formoterol ratio 1.032; 95% confidence interval: 1.013-1.052; P = 0.0011). The budesonide/formoterol group had a significantly prolonged time to first exacerbation versus the formoterol group (hazard ratio: 0.679; 95% confidence interval: 0.507-0.909; P = 0.0094) and significantly greater improvements in many secondary outcome measures. Both treatments were well tolerated; the incidence and type of adverse events were similar: most commonly reported (budesonide/formoterol vs formoterol): COPD (8.0% vs 9.4%) and nasopharyngitis (5.5% vs 4.9%). Conclusions Budesonide/formoterol 160/4.5 μg two inhalations twice daily was effective and well tolerated in patients with moderate to severe COPD, offering benefits over formoterol alone in terms of improved lung function and reduced risk of exacerbation.";Respiratory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train
346;23578980;The effect of indacaterol during an acute exacerbation of COPD.;Some clinical trials have suggested that the inhaled long-acting β2-agonists (LABAs) may be effective in the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD). Since indacaterol, the first once-daily LABA to be developed for the regular treatment of COPD, exhibits fast onset of action and 24-h duration of bronchodilation, we have investigated its effects in patients with AECOPD managed in the emergency department. In a randomised controlled pilot trial, we have enrolled 29 consecutive patients with a recent (i.e., within ≤ 4 d) history of AECOPD and requiring hospitalization. All patients received a standard protocol consisting of ipratropium bromide aerosol 500 μg three times a day, intravenous methylprednisolone 20 mg twice-daily and, if indicated, oral levofloxacin 500 mg once-daily. Moreover, they were randomly allocated to one of the two 5-day treatment groups (indacaterol maleate 300 μg once-daily or salbutamol nebulizer 1250 μg three times a day). The administration of indacaterol 300 μg to patients admitted to emergency department for an AECOPD resulted in a greater improvement of pulmonary function compared with traditional therapy, without cardiovascular side effects. Our results suggest that indacaterol could be a useful option in the treatment of AECOPD. However, further larger double-blinded randomized clinical trials are needed to validate the intriguing results obtained in this setting.;Respiratory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Test

This was a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled, 26-week trial. Patients (n = 2144) were randomised (2:2:2:2:1) to receive once-daily QVA149 (indacaterol 110 μg/glycopyrronium 50 μg), indacaterol 150 μg, glycopyrronium 50 μg, open-label tiotropium 18 μg or placebo. The primary end-point was trough forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) at week 26 for QVA149 versus its monocomponents. Secondary end-points included dyspnoea, health status, rescue medication use and safety. Trough FEV1 at week 26 was significantly improved (p<0.001) with QVA149 compared with indacaterol and glycopyrronium (least squares mean (LSM) differences 0.07 L and 0.09 L, respectively), tiotropium and placebo (LSM differences 0.08 L and 0.20 L, respectively); these beneficial effects were sustained throughout the 26-week study.

349;23815552;A randomised cross-over trial investigating the ease of use and preference of two dry powder inhalers in patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.;"Objectives The objective of this randomised, cross-over study was to compare a new single-dose dry powder inhaler (Elpenhaler (EH)), with a widely used, multi-dose dry powder inhaler (Diskus (DK)) on critical errors, patient preference, and satisfaction with the inhalers. Methods First, patients read the instructions of one device, followed by a first inhalation attempt. Inhalation errors were assessed and if mistakes were made, correct inhaler use was demonstrated. Then patients had to demonstrate again and mistakes were registered. This was repeated up to four times. After completing the first device, the same procedure was started with the second inhaler. Primary outcome was the percentage of patients making at least one critical error after reading the insert. Secondary outcomes were inhaler preference and satisfaction with the inhalers. Results After reading the insert, 19 of 113 patients (17%) made at least one critical error with DK and 40 (35%) with EH (p = 0.001); 73% preferred the DK and 27% the EH (p < 0.001). The mean overall satisfaction score (1 = very satisfied; 5 = very dissatisfied) for DK was 1.59 and for EH 2.48 (p < 0.001). Conclusion With DK fewer errors were made, more patients preferred DK over EH and patients were more satisfied with DK.

351;23992515;Tiotropium Respimat inhaler and the risk of death in COPD.;"Background Tiotropium delivered at a dose of 5 μg with the Respimat inhaler showed efficacy similar to that of 18 μg of tiotropium delivered with the HandiHaler inhalation device in placebo-controlled trials involving patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Although tiotropium HandiHaler was associated with reduced mortality, as compared with placebo, more deaths were reported with tiotropium Respimat than with placebo. Methods In this randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial involving 17,135 patients with COPD, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of tiotropium Respimat at a once-daily dose of 2.5 μg or 5 μg, as compared with tiotropium HandiHaler at a once-daily dose of 18 μg. Primary end points were the risk of death (noninferiority study, Respimat at a dose of 5 μg or 2.5 μg vs. HandiHaler) and the risk of the first COPD exacerbation (superiority study, Respimat at a dose of 5 μg vs. HandiHaler). We also assessed cardiovascular safety, including safety in patients with stable cardiac disease. Results During a mean follow-up of 2.3 years, Respimat was noninferior to HandiHaler with respect to the risk of death (Respimat at a dose of 5 μg vs. HandiHaler: hazard ratio, 0.96; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.84 to 1.09; Respimat at a dose of 2.5 μg vs. HandiHaler: hazard ratio, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.87 to 1.14) and not superior to HandiHaler with respect to the risk of the first exacerbation (Respimat at a dose of 5 μg vs. HandiHaler: hazard ratio, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.93 to 1.03). Causes of death and incidences of major cardiovascular adverse events were similar in the three groups. Conclusions Tiotropium Respimat at a dose of 5 μg or 2.5 μg had a safety profile and exacerbation efficacy similar to those of tiotropium HandiHaler at a dose of 18 μg in patients with COPD.

352;24074143;Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol delivered as a combination dry powder from a capsule-based inhaler and a multidose inhaler in asthma and COPD patients.;Background The object of this study was to assess whether a capsule-based and multidose dry powder inhaler containing salmeterol (as xinafoate salt) 50 μg plus fluticasone propionate (FP) 250 μg [combination (SFC 50/250)] could be equivalent in terms of in vivo drug delivery and systemic exposure. Methods This was a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, replicate treatment design comparative bioavailability study of SFC 50/250 delivered in a capsule-based inhaler (Rotahaler®) and a multidose dry powder inhaler (Diskus®). Subjects with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary (COPD) disease (n=60) were randomized to receive twice-daily SFC 50/250 via a Rotahaler and via Diskus each for two 10-day treatment periods (GlaxoSmithKline Protocol ASR114334). Results For FP and salmeterol, the in vitro aerodynamic particle size profiles were within±15% of Diskus for the fine particle mass (FPM) and emitted dose (ED) using the Andersen Cascade Impactor, and ED, mass median aerodynamic diameter, and geometric standard deviation using the New Generation Impactor (NGI). This was also the case for FP but not salmeterol for FPM and fine particle dose using the NGI. For the combined asthma and COPD subjects, the plasma AUC and Cmax for FP and salmeterol were higher for Rotahaler:Rotahaler/Diskus geometric mean ratios (90% confidence intervals) for FP AUC0-τ of 1.52 (1.37-1.67) and Cmax of 1.94 (1.75-2.10) and salmeterol AUC0-τ of 1.15 (1.09-1.21) and Cmax of 1.56 (1.42-1.67). Corresponding values for the primary pharmacodynamic endpoint, weighted mean (0-12 hr) serum cortisol, were 0.928 (0.886-0.971). Inhaled FP/salmeterol via both inhalers was well-tolerated. One serious adverse event, considered possibly related to study medication, resulted in subject withdrawal from the study. Conclusions The in vitro tests and systemic pharmacodynamic endpoints revealed no major differences between the two inhalers, but lacked predictive power and sensitivity to guide in vivo drug delivery performance and systemic exposure. Based on pharmacokinetic endpoints, the inhalers were not considered bioequivalent in terms of systemic exposure.

This 12-week phase III study evaluated efficacy and tolerability of aclidinium 200 or 400 μg in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD. Methods In this double-blind study, 544 patients with COPD were randomized to placebo or twice-daily aclidinium 200 or 400 μg administered by Genuair(®)/Pressair(®). Lung function, health status [measured by the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ)], dyspnea [measured using the Transition Dyspnea Index (TDI)], and safety were assessed throughout the study. Results Mean changes from baseline in morning trough forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) at week 12 (primary endpoint) were significantly higher for aclidinium than for placebo (200 μg, 51 mL; 400 μg, 72 mL; both p < 0.05). Aclidinium also significantly improved other lung function outcomes. At week 12, improvements from baseline were observed with aclidinium in SGRQ total score (200 μg, -6.0; 400 μg, -5.4) and TDI focal score (200 μg, 1.0; 400 μg, 1.3). Furthermore, clinically important improvements in SGRQ total and TDI focal scores were achieved by 45 and 51 % of patients, respectively, who received aclidinium 400 μg, with a significant difference versus placebo for TDI (p < 0.05).

In total 154 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were included in this multicenter, randomized, double-blind within-solution (1.25, 2.5, 5 µg, and placebo), and open-label powder 18 µg, crossover study, including 4-week treatment periods. Primary end points were peak plasma concentration (Cmax,ss ), and area under the plasma concentration-time profile (AUC0-6h,ss ), both at steady state. The pharmacodynamic response was assessed by serial spirometry (forced expiratory volume in 1 second/forced vital capacity). Safety was evaluated as adverse events and by electrocardiogram/Holter. Tiotropium was rapidly absorbed with a median tmax,ss of 5-7 minutes postdosing for both devices.

Previous studies have compared glycopyrronium with open-label tiotropium. In the GLOW5 study, we compare glycopyrronium with blinded tiotropium. Methods In this blinded, double-dummy, parallel group, 12-week study, patients with moderate-to-severe COPD were randomized 1:1 to glycopyrronium 50 μg once daily or tiotropium 18 μg once daily. The primary objective was to demonstrate the non-inferiority of glycopyrronium versus blinded tiotropium with respect to trough forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) following 12 weeks of treatment (non-inferiority margin: -50 mL). Secondary objectives were to evaluate glycopyrronium versus tiotropium for other spirometric outcomes, breathlessness (Transition Dyspnea Index; TDI), health status (St George's Respiratory Questionnaire; SGRQ), daily rescue medication use, COPD exacerbations and COPD symptoms over 12 weeks of treatment. Results 657 patients were randomized (glycopyrronium: 327; tiotropium: 330); 96% (630 patients) completed the study. Least squares mean trough FEV1 for both glycopyrronium and tiotropium was 1.405 L at Week 12, meeting the criterion for non-inferiority (mean treatment difference: 0 mL, 95% CI: -32, 31 mL). Glycopyrronium demonstrated rapid bronchodilation following first dose on Day 1, with significantly higher FEV1 at all time points from 0-4 h post-dose versus tiotropium (all p < 0.001). FEV1 area under the curve from 0-4 h (AUC0-4h) post-dose with glycopyrronium was significantly superior to tiotropium on Day 1 (p < 0.001) and was comparable to tiotropium at Week 12.

Analysis populations for the primary and key secondary endpoints were per-protocol sets. The safety set included all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00845728. Findings Between March 16, 2009, and July 5, 2012, we enrolled and randomly allocated 3444 patients: 1723 to indacaterol and 1721 to tiotropium. At week 12, the estimated least squares mean trough FEV1 difference between the groups was -0.011 L (least squares mean with indacaterol [n=1450] 1.134 L [SE 0.008] vs tiotropium [n=1467] 1.145 L [0.008]; one-sided 97.5% CI lower limit -0.026 L; p<0.0001). The lower limit of the 97.5% CI was above the prespecified non-inferiority margin of -0.055 L, suggesting that indacaterol was non-inferior to tiotropium. Indacaterol did not show non-inferiority in terms of annualised exacerbation rates: 0.79 (indacaterol, n=1529) versus 0.61 (tiotropium, n=1543); ratio 1.29 (one-sided 97.5% CI upper limit 1.44). In the safety set, we recorded no between-group difference in the number of patients who had adverse events (indacaterol 1119 [65%] of 1721 patients vs tiotropium 1065 [62%] of 1718 patients) or serious adverse events (indacaterol, 263 [15%] of 1721 patients vs tiotropium, 255 [15%] of 1718 patients). Respiratory disorders, particularly worsening of COPD, were the most common adverse events (COPD: indacaterol, 747 [43%] of 1721 patients and tiotropium, 665 [39%] of 1718 patients) and serious adverse events (COPD: indacaterol, 147 [9%] of 1721 patients and tiotropium, 121 [7%] of 1718 patients). Interpretation Indacaterol and tiotropium provided clinically relevant improvements in lung function with comparable safety profiles. Tiotropium afforded greater protection from exacerbations, although the absolute number of events was small and the difference between treatments is of uncertain clinical importance. The present data offer evidence consistent with current guidelines. Funding Novartis Pharma AG.";Respiratory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train
358;24596459;Efficacy and safety of coadministration of once-daily indacaterol and glycopyrronium versus indacaterol alone in COPD patients: the GLOW6 study.;"Background Addition of a second bronchodilator from a different pharmacological class may benefit patients with moderate-to-severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) whose symptoms are insufficiently controlled by bronchodilator monotherapy. GLOW6 evaluated the efficacy and safety of once-daily coadministration of the long-acting β2-agonist indacaterol (IND) and the long-acting muscarinic antagonist glycopyrronium (GLY) versus IND alone in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD. Materials and methods In this randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled, 12-week study, patients were randomized 1:1 to IND 150 μg and GLY 50 μg daily (IND + GLY) or IND 150 μg daily and placebo (IND + PBO) (all delivered via separate Breezhaler® devices). The primary objective was to demonstrate the superiority of IND + GLY versus IND + PBO for trough forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) at week 12. Other end points included trough FEV1 at day 1, FEV1 area under the curve from 30 minutes to 4 hours (AUC30min-4h), peak FEV1, inspiratory capacity and trough forced vital capacity (FVC) at day 1 and week 12, and transition dyspnea index (TDI) focal score, COPD symptoms, and rescue medication use over 12 weeks. Results A total of 449 patients were randomized (IND + GLY, 226; IND + PBO, 223); 94% completed the study. On day 1 and at week 12, IND + GLY significantly improved trough FEV1 versus IND + PBO, with treatment differences of 74 mL (95% CI 46-101 mL) and 64 mL (95% CI 28-99 mL), respectively (both P<0.001). IND + GLY significantly improved postdose peak FEV1, FEV1 AUC30min-4h, and trough FVC at day 1 and week 12 versus IND + PBO (all P<0.01). TDI focal score and COPD symptoms (percentage of days able to perform usual daily activities and change from baseline in mean daytime respiratory score) were significantly improved with IND + GLY versus IND + PBO (P<0.05). The incidence of adverse events was similar for the two treatment groups. Conclusion In patients with moderate-to-severe COPD, once-daily coadministration of IND and GLY provides significant and sustained improvement in bronchodilation versus IND alone from day 1, with significant improvements in patient-centered outcomes.";Respiratory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train
359;24621680;Twice daily N-acetylcysteine 600 mg for exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (PANTHEON): a randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trial.;"Background Increased oxidative stress and inflammation has a role in the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Drugs with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, such as N-acetylcysteine, might provide a useful therapeutic approach for COPD. We aimed to assess whether N-acetylcysteine could reduce the rate of exacerbations in patients with COPD. Methods In our prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study, we enrolled patients aged 40-80 years with moderate-to-severe COPD (post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s [FEV1]/forced vital capacity <0·7 and FEV1 of 30-70% of predicted) at 34 hospitals in China. We stratified patients according to use of inhaled corticosteroids (regular use or not) at baseline and randomly allocated them to receive N-acetylcysteine (one 600 mg tablet, twice daily) or matched placebo for 1 year. The primary endpoint was the annual exacerbation rate in patients who received at least one dose of study drug and had at least one assessment visit after randomisation. This study is registered with the Chinese Clinical Trials Registry, ChiCTR-TRC-09000460. Findings Between June 25, 2009, and Dec 29, 2010, we screened 1297 patients, of whom 1006 were eligible for randomisation (504 to N-acetylcysteine and 502 to placebo). After 1 year, we noted 497 acute exacerbations in 482 patients in the N-acetylcysteine group who received at least one dose and had at least one assessment visit (1·16 exacerbations per patient-year) and 641 acute exacerbations in 482 patients in the placebo group (1·49 exacerbations per patient-year; risk ratio 0·78, 95% CI 0·67-0·90; p=0·0011). N-acetylcysteine was well tolerated: 146 (29%) of 495 patients who received at least one dose of N-acetylcysteine had adverse events (48 serious), as did 130 (26%) of 495 patients who received at least one dose of placebo (46 serious). The most common serious adverse event was acute exacerbation of COPD, occurring in 32 (6%) of 495 patients in the N-acetylcysteine group and 36 (7%) of 495 patients in the placebo group. Interpretation Our findings show that in Chinese patients with moderate-to-severe COPD, long-term use of N-acetylcysteine 600 mg twice daily can prevent exacerbations, especially in disease of moderate severity.

360;24717626;Tadalafil in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial.;"Background Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitors improve exercise capacity and quality of life in patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension. However, whether such beneficial effects take place in selected populations with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) remains uncertain. We aimed to assess the effects of tadalafil--a PDE5 inhibitor--on exercise capacity and quality of life in patients with COPD and mild pulmonary hypertension. Methods We did a randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial at three centres in Scotland, UK, between Sept 1, 2010, and Sept 1, 2012. Patients with moderate to severe COPD were randomly assigned (1:1), via centralised randomisation with a computer-generated sequence and block sizes of four, to receive daily tadalafil 10 mg or placebo for 12 weeks. Patients, study investigators, outcome assessors, and those administering drugs were masked to group allocation. The primary endpoint was the mean placebo-corrected difference between the baseline and final 6 min walk distance after 12 weeks. We measured change in quality of life at baseline, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks, with standardised questionnaires. Analysis was per protocol and by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01197469. Findings 120 patients were randomly assigned to receive tadalafil (n=60) or placebo (n=60), of whom 56 (93%) versus 57 (95%) completed the study. At 12 weeks the difference in 6 min walking distance between the tadalafil and placebo groups was 0·5 m (95% CI -11·6 to 12·5; p=0·937). We recorded no statistically significant changes in quality of life (between-group difference on the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire -2·64 [95% CI -6·43 to 1·15]; Research and Development version 1 short-form-36 4·08 [-1·35 to 9·52]; Minnesota Living with Heart Failure questionnaire -2·31 [-7·06 to 2·45]). 19 (32%) of 60 patients in the treatment group had dyspepsia; the severity of dyspepsia ranged from mild to severe, with four (21%) of 19 patients needing a proton-pump inhibitor. Five (8%) of 60 participants had dyspepsia in the placebo group. Headache was noted in 17 (28%) patients in the treatment group versus 5 (8%) in the placebo group, but was mild in all patients. Two (3%) patients in the treatment group had facial flushing, which resulted in one withdrawal. Other withdrawals within the tadalafil group happened after a transient ischaemic attack and two deaths (ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm and pneumonia).

361;24841833;Tiotropium in patients with moderate COPD naive to maintenance therapy: a randomised placebo-controlled trial.;"Background The benefits of pharmacotherapy with tiotropium HandiHaler 18 μg for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have been previously demonstrated. However, few data exist regarding the treatment of moderate disease (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) stage II). Aims To determine whether tiotropium improves lung function/patient-reported outcomes in patients with GOLD stage II COPD naive to maintenance therapy. Methods A randomised 24-week double-blind placebo-controlled trial of tiotropium 18 μg once daily (via HandiHaler) was performed in maintenance therapy-naive patients with forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio <0.7 and post-bronchodilator FEV1 ≥50 and <80%. Results A total of 457 patients were randomised (238 tiotropium, 219 placebo; mean age 62 years; FEV1 1.93 l (66% predicted)). Tiotropium was superior to placebo in mean change from baseline in post-dose FEV1 area under the curve from 0 to 3 h (AUC0-3h) at week 24 (primary endpoint): 0.19 vs. -0.03 l (least-squares mean difference 0.23 l, P<0.001). FVC AUC0-3h, trough and peak FEV1 and FVC were significantly improved with tiotropium versus placebo (P<0.001). Compared with placebo, tiotropium provided numerical improvements in physical activity (P=NS). Physician's Global Assessment (health status) improved (P=0.045) with less impairment on the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment questionnaire (P=0.043) at week 24. The incidence of exacerbations, cough, bronchitis and dyspnoea was lower with tiotropium than placebo. Conclusions Tiotropium improved lung function and patient-reported outcomes in maintenance therapy-naive patients with GOLD stage II COPD, suggesting benefits in initiating maintenance therapy early.";Respiratory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train
362;25058845;Long-acting bronchodilators and arterial stiffness in patients with COPD: a comparison of fluticasone furoate/vilanterol with tiotropium.;"Background Increased arterial stiffness as measured by aortic pulse wave velocity (aPWV) predicts cardiovascular events and mortality and is elevated in patients with COPD. Prior investigation suggests that a long-acting β-agonist (LABA)/inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) lowers aPWV in patients with baseline aPWV ≥ 11 m/s. This study compared the effect of the ICS/LABA fluticasone furoate/vilanterol (FF/VI), 100/25 μg, delivered via the ELLIPTA dry powder inhaler, with tiotropium bromide (TIO), 18 μg, on aPWV. Methods This multicenter, randomized, blinded, double-dummy, parallel-group, 12-week study compared FF/VI and TIO, both administered once daily. The primary end point was aPWV change from baseline at 12 weeks. Safety end points included adverse events (AEs), vital signs, and clinical laboratory tests. Results Two hundred fifty-seven patients with COPD and aPWV ≥ 11 m/s were randomized; 87% had prior cardiovascular events and/or risk. The mean difference in aPWV between FF/VI and TIO at week 12 was not significant (P = .484). Because the study did not contain a placebo arm, a post hoc analysis was performed to show that both treatments lowered aPWV by an approximate difference of 1 m/s compared with baseline. The proportion of patients reporting AEs was similar with FF/VI (24%) and TIO (18%). There were no changes in clinical concern for vital signs or clinical laboratory tests. Conclusions No differences on aPWV were observed between FF/VI and TIO. However, further studies with a placebo arm are required to establish definitively whether long-acting bronchodilators lower aPWV. Both treatments demonstrated an acceptable tolerability profile.

363;25060541;A randomized study of formoterol fumarate in a porous particle metered-dose inhaler in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD.;Background Formoterol fumarate (FF) is a well-established long-acting β2-agonist. This represents the first clinical study of FF in a metered-dose inhaler (FF MDI) based on proprietary lipid-based porous-particle engineering technology. Methods In this randomized, double-blind, 5-period, crossover study (NCT00880490), subjects received 2.4, 4.8, and 9.6 μg of FF MDI, open-label Foradil(®) Aerolizer(®) (FA) 12 μg, and placebo. Spirometry was performed at baseline, 15 and 30 min, and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11.5, and 12 h post-dose. Results Thirty-four subjects were enrolled. Improvement in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) was similar between FF MDI 9.6 μg and FA. Change in FEV1 area under the curve for 0-12 h (AUC0-12) for each FF MDI dose demonstrated superior efficacy versus placebo (P < .001 for all 3 doses). Over 12 h and at each time point, FF MDI 9.6 μg was non-inferior to FA for FEV1 AUC0-12 with the 95% CI's supporting a maximum difference of approximately 45 mL. Peak and trough FEV1, forced vital capacity, peak expiratory flow rate, peak inspiratory capacity, and pharmacokinetics confirmed the primary endpoint, with dose ordering of the FF MDI 2.4, 4.8, and 9.6 μg, and comparability of FF MDI 9.6 μg to FA. All 3 doses of FF MDI were safe and well-tolerated, with a safety profile similar to that of placebo and FA. Conclusions The efficacy and pharmacokinetic profile of FF MDI 9.6 μg were comparable to FA 12 μg and with similar safety to placebo and FA.

This 26-week, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group, phase IV study, randomised 581 patients with moderate COPD to indacaterol 150 μg once daily or SFC 50/500 μg twice daily. Patients had been receiving SFC 50/500 μg for ≥3 months, with no COPD exacerbations for more than a year before the study (patients for whom ICS is not recommended). The primary objective was to demonstrate non-inferiority of indacaterol to SFC, measured by trough forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV₁) after 12 weeks (non-inferiority margin of 0.06 L). The primary objective was met, with a mean treatment difference of 9 mL (95% CI -45-26 mL). There were no significant differences between treatments in terms of breathlessness (transition dyspnoea index) or health status (Saint George's Respiratory Questionnaire) at weeks 12 or 26, or rescue medication use or COPD exacerbation rates over 26 weeks.

The GLOW7 study evaluated the efficacy and safety of od glycopyrronium 50 μg in predominantly Chinese patients with moderate-to-severe COPD. Methods In this 26-week, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study, men and women ≥40 years with moderate-to-severe COPD were randomized to glycopyrronium 50 μg od or placebo (2:1). The primary objective was to confirm the significant improvement of trough forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) following 12 weeks of treatment with glycopyrronium compared with placebo. Secondary objectives included the effect of glycopyrronium on health status (St George's Respiratory Questionnaire), breathlessness (Transition Dyspnea Index), other lung function parameters, rescue medication use, and COPD exacerbations. Safety and tolerability were also evaluated. Results Of the 460 patients randomized, 459 were included in the full analysis set (glycopyrronium, n=306; placebo, n=154; mean age 64.7 years; mean post-bronchodilator FEV1: 50.8% predicted); 425 (92.4%) completed the study. At Week 12, glycopyrronium signifcantly improved trough FEV1 with a least square means treatment difference of 141 mL (95% confidence interval 111 mL, 171 mL; P<0.001) compared with placebo. The mean treatment effect of glycopyrronium was greater than the minimum clinically important difference versus placebo in both St George's Respiratory Questionnaire total score (-4.92; P<0.001) and Transition Dyspnea Index focal score (1.0; P<0.001) at week 26. Glycopyrronium reduced the risk of exacerbations in terms of time to first moderate or severe exacerbation by 28% (P=0.153) and rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbation by 29% (P=0.119) compared with placebo. Incidence of death was 1.3% with glycopyrronium and 0% in placebo during the treatment period.

Objective This Phase II, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-finding study evaluated four doses of once-daily olodaterol over 4 weeks in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), based on efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetic parameters. Methods Patients received olodaterol inhalation solution or placebo via Respimat® Soft Mist™ inhaler once daily for 4 weeks. Pulmonary function testing was performed pre-dose (trough) and up to 3 or 6 h post-dose, depending on visit. Primary end point was change from baseline in trough forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) after 4 weeks' treatment. Secondary end points included change from baseline in peak FEV1 and FEV1 area under the curve from 0 to 6 h. Results 405 patients with COPD were randomised and assigned to treatment. Mean baseline post-bronchodilator FEV1 was 1.50 L (54% predicted). All olodaterol doses provided statistically significant increases in trough FEV1 compared to placebo (2 μg: 0.061 L [p = 0.0233]; 5 μg: 0.097 L [p = 0.0003]; 10 μg: 0.123 L [p < 0.0001]; 20 μg: 0.132 L [p < 0.0001]). A clear dose-response relationship was demonstrated regarding pulmonary function; the two highest olodaterol doses (10 and 20 μg) formed the plateau of the dose-response curve.

Aims To assess patient preference, satisfaction and critical inhaler technique errors with Genuair (a multidose inhaler) and Breezhaler (a single-dose inhaler) after 2 weeks of daily use. Methods Patients with COPD and moderate to severe airflow obstruction were randomised in a cross-over, open-label, multicentre study to consecutive once-daily inhalations of placebo via Genuair and Breezhaler, in addition to current COPD medication. The primary end point was the proportion of patients who preferred Genuair versus Breezhaler after 2 weeks (Patient Satisfaction and Preference Questionnaire). Other end points included overall satisfaction and correct use of the inhalers after 2 weeks, and willingness to continue with each device. Results Of the 128 patients enrolled, 127 were included in the safety population (male n=91; mean age 67.6 years). Of the 110 of the 123 patients in the intent-to-treat population who indicated an inhaler preference, statistically significantly more patients preferred Genuair than Breezhaler (72.7 vs. 27.3%; P<0.001).

The device is intended to provide dose equivalence with enhanced user-friendliness compared to BF Turbuhaler® in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The present study was performed to compare inhalation parameters with empty versions of the two devices, and to investigate the effects of enhanced training designed to encourage faster inhalation. Methods This randomised, open-label, cross-over study included children with asthma (n = 23), adolescents with asthma (n = 27), adults with asthma (n = 50), adults with COPD (n = 50) and healthy adult volunteers (n = 50). Inhalation manoeuvres were recorded with each device after training with the patient information leaflet (PIL) and after enhanced training using an In-Check Dial device. Results After PIL training, peak inspiratory flow (PIF), maximum change in pressure (∆P) and the inhalation volume (IV) were significantly higher with Spiromax than with the Turbuhaler device (p values were at least <0.05 in all patient groups). After enhanced training, numerically or significantly higher values for PIF, ∆P, IV and acceleration remained with Spiromax versus Turbuhaler, except for ∆P in COPD patients. After PIL training, one adult asthma patient and one COPD patient inhaled <30 L/min through the Spiromax compared to one adult asthma patient and five COPD patients with the Turbuhaler. All patients achieved PIF values of at least 30 L/min after enhanced training. Conclusions The two inhalers have similar resistance so inhalation flows and pressure changes would be expected to be similar. The higher flow-related values noted for Spiromax versus Turbuhaler after PIL training suggest that Spiromax might have human factor advantages in real-world use. After enhanced training, the flow-related differences between devices persisted; increased flow rates were achieved with both devices, and all patients achieved the minimal flow required for adequate drug delivery. Enhanced training could be useful, especially in COPD patients.";Respiratory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train

We compared the safety and efficacy of FF/VI and tiotropium (TIO) in subjects with moderate-to-severe COPD with greater risk for comorbid cardiovascular disease (CVD). Methods This randomized, blinded, double-dummy, parallel-group study compared a once-daily morning dose of FF/VI 100/25 mcg delivered via ELLIPTA™ with TIO 18 mcg via HandiHaler(®) for 12 weeks in subjects with diagnosed COPD, forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) 30%-70% predicted, and CVD or CVD risk. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in 24-hour weighted mean FEV1 on Day 84. Other efficacy endpoints included time to onset of bronchodilation, trough FEV1, other spirometry measures, rescue medication use, symptoms, quality of life (St George's Respiratory Questionnaire-COPD [SGRQ-C]), and health status (COPD Assessment Tests [CAT]) measures. Safety endpoints included cardiovascular monitoring, cortisol excretion, COPD exacerbations, and adverse events, including prespecified drug effects. Results Both FF/VI and TIO improved the 24-hour weighted mean FEV1 from baseline after 12 weeks with no significant difference between treatments. Other endpoints favored FF/VI for time to onset of bronchodilation, rescue medication use, dyspnea, SGRQ-C and CAT scores, or favored TIO for change from baseline in forced vital capacity and inspiratory capacity. Pneumonia occurred more frequently in the FF/VI group, and two TIO-treated subjects died following cardiovascular events. Other safety measures were similar between groups, and cardiovascular monitoring did not reveal increased CVD risk. Conclusion Both FF/VI and TIO were efficacious in improving lung function in subjects with COPD and comorbid CVD or CVD risk factors, with minor differences in efficacy and safety profiles.;Respiratory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train

Indacaterol-glycopyrronium showed not only noninferiority but also superiority to salmeterol-fluticasone in reducing the annual rate of all COPD exacerbations; the rate was 11% lower in the indacaterol-glycopyrronium group than in the salmeterol-fluticasone group (3.59 vs. 4.03; rate ratio, 0.89; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.83 to 0.96; P=0.003). The indacaterol-glycopyrronium group had a longer time to the first exacerbation than did the salmeterol-fluticasone group (71 days [95% CI, 60 to 82] vs. 51 days [95% CI, 46 to 57]; hazard ratio, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.78 to 0.91], representing a 16% lower risk; P<0.001). The annual rate of moderate or severe exacerbations was lower in the indacaterol-glycopyrronium group than in the salmeterol-fluticasone group (0.98 vs. 1.19; rate ratio, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.75 to 0.91; P<0.001), and the time to the first moderate or severe exacerbation was longer in the indacaterol-glycopyrronium group than in the salmeterol-fluticasone group (hazard ratio, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.70 to 0.86; P<0.001), as was the time to the first severe exacerbation (hazard ratio, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.66 to 1.00; P=0.046). The effect of indacaterol-glycopyrronium versus salmeterol-fluticasone on the rate of COPD exacerbations was independent of the baseline blood eosinophil count. The incidence of adverse events and deaths was similar in the two groups. The incidence of pneumonia was 3.2% in the indacaterol-glycopyrronium group and 4.8% in the salmeterol-fluticasone group (P=0.02). Conclusions Indacaterol-glycopyrronium was more effective than salmeterol-fluticasone in preventing COPD exacerbations in patients with a history of exacerbation during the previous year.

371;27215502;Long-term safety of glycopyrrolate: A randomized study in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD (GEM3).;"Background Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the leading causes of death in the United States. Long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) are a class of medications used as maintenance therapy for COPD. The GEM3 (Glycopyrrolate Effect on syMptoms and lung function) study assessed the long-term safety and efficacy of a LAMA, glycopyrrolate (GLY) 15.6 μg twice daily (b.i.d.), compared with an approved long-acting β2-agonist (LABA), indacaterol (IND) 75 μg once daily (q.d.) in patients with stable, symptomatic COPD with moderate-to-severe airflow limitation. Methods This 52-week, multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group study randomized patients (1:1) of the United States to receive GLY 15.6 μg b.i.d. or IND 75 μg q.d. both delivered via the Neohaler(®) device. The primary objective was to assess the safety and tolerability in terms of adverse event (AE) reporting rates over 52 weeks. Safety was also determined by evaluating multiple secondary endpoints, including vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and time to first moderate or severe exacerbation. Efficacy-related secondary endpoints included pre-dose forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC). Results Of the 511 randomized patients (GLY, n = 254; IND, n = 257), 81.6% completed the study. The overall incidences of AEs (GLY, 77.3%; IND, 77.0%) and serious AEs (GLY, 13.1%; IND, 13.3%) were comparable between the groups. The incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events was low and comparable between the groups. No clinically relevant differences for vital signs or ECG parameters were observed between the treatment groups. The three sudden deaths reported within 30 days of the treatment (GLY, n = 2; IND, n = 1) were adjudicated as unrelated to the study medication. In terms of efficacy, GLY 15.6 μg b.i.d. showed improvements in pre-dose FEV1 and FVC from baseline, which was comparable to those with IND 75 μg q.d., with no statistically significant differences. No significant differences were observed between the treatment groups in the time to first moderate or severe COPD exacerbation. Conclusion GLY 15.6 μg b.i.d. showed a long-term safety profile comparable to that of IND 75 μg q.d. and provided rapid and sustained bronchodilation over 52 weeks in patients with COPD with moderate-to-severe airflow limitation.

Patients were randomised (1:1) to aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 µg twice-daily via Genuair/Pressair or salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 µg twice-daily via Accuhaler. The primary end-point was peak forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV) at week 24. Other end-points included Transition Dyspnoea Index (TDI) focal score at week 24, TDI and St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) responders, COPD Assessment Test and SGRQ scores, assessment of COPD symptoms and exacerbations, use of reliever medication, and device preference. Adverse events were monitored throughout.In total, 933 patients were eligible (mean age 63.4 years, 65.1% male). Aclidinium/formoterol was superior to salmeterol/fluticasone in peak FEV and noninferior in TDI. Health status and reduction in exacerbation risk were similar in both groups. While both treatments were well tolerated, pneumonia occurred less frequently with aclidinium/formoterol than salmeterol/fluticasone.In stable COPD, aclidinium/formoterol significantly improved bronchodilation versus salmeterol/fluticasone, with equivalent benefits in symptom control and reduction in exacerbation risk. Both treatments were well tolerated and treatment-related adverse events were less common with aclidinium/formoterol.;Respiratory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train
373;27593504;Effectiveness of Fluticasone Furoate-Vilanterol for COPD in Clinical Practice.;"Background Evidence for the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) comes from closely monitored efficacy trials involving groups of patients who were selected on the basis of restricted entry criteria. There is a need for randomized trials to be conducted in conditions that are closer to usual clinical practice. Methods In a controlled effectiveness trial conducted in 75 general practices, we randomly assigned 2799 patients with COPD to a once-daily inhaled combination of fluticasone furoate at a dose of 100 μg and vilanterol at a dose of 25 μg (the fluticasone furoate-vilanterol group) or to usual care (the usual-care group). The primary outcome was the rate of moderate or severe exacerbations among patients who had had an exacerbation within 1 year before the trial. Secondary outcomes were the rates of primary care contact (contact with a general practitioner, nurse, or other health care professional) and secondary care contact (inpatient admission, outpatient visit with a specialist, or visit to the emergency department), modification of the initial trial treatment for COPD, and the rate of exacerbations among patients who had had an exacerbation within 3 years before the trial, as assessed in a time-to-event analysis. Results The rate of moderate or severe exacerbations was significantly lower, by 8.4% (95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 15.2), with fluticasone furoate-vilanterol therapy than with usual care (P=0.02). There was no significant difference in the annual rate of COPD-related contacts to primary or secondary care. There were no significant between-group differences in the rates of the first moderate or severe exacerbation and the first severe exacerbation in the time-to-event analyses. There were no excess serious adverse events of pneumonia in the fluticasone furoate-vilanterol group. The numbers of other serious adverse events were similar in the two groups. Conclusions In patients with COPD and a history of exacerbations, a once-daily treatment regimen of combined fluticasone furoate and vilanterol was associated with a lower rate of exacerbations than usual care, without a greater risk of serious adverse events.

374;27598678;Single inhaler triple therapy versus inhaled corticosteroid plus long-acting β2-agonist therapy for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (TRILOGY): a double-blind, parallel group, randomised controlled trial.;"Background Few data are available for the efficacy of ""triple therapy"" with two long-acting bronchodilators and an inhaled corticosteroid in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We designed this study to assess efficacy of single-inhaler combination of an extra fine formulation of beclometasone dipropionate, formoterol fumarate, and glycopyrronium bromide (BDP/FF/GB) in COPD compared with beclometasone dipropionate and formoterol fumarate (BDP/FF) treatment. Methods TRILOGY was a randomised, parallel group, double-blind, active-controlled study done in 159 sites across 14 countries. The sites were a mixture of primary, secondary, and tertiary care providers, and specialist investigation units. Eligible patients with COPD had post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) of lower than 50%, one or more moderate-to-severe COPD exacerbation in the previous 12 months, COPD Assessment Test total score of 10 or more, and a Baseline Dyspnea Index focal score of 10 or less. Patients who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria at screening entered a 2-week open-label run-in period where they received beclometasone dipropionate (100 μg) and formoterol fumarate (6 μg) in two actuations twice daily. Patients were then randomly assigned (1:1) with an interactive response technology system to either continue BDP (100 μg) and FF (6 μg) or step-up to BDP (100 μg), FF (6 μg), and GB (12·5 μg) in two actuations twice daily for 52 weeks via pressurised metered-dose inhaler. The three co-primary endpoints were pre-dose FEV1, 2-h post-dose FEV1, and Transition Dyspnea Index (TDI) focal score, all measured at week 26 in the intention-to-treat population (all patients who were randomly assigned and received at least one dose of study drug and had at least one post-baseline efficacy assessment). Safety outcomes were measured in the safety population (all patients who were randomly assigned and received at least one dose of study drug). Secondary endpoints included moderate-to-severe COPD exacerbation rate over 52 weeks. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT01917331. Findings Between March 21, 2014, and Jan 14, 2016, 1368 patients received either BDP/FF/GB (n=687) or BDP/FF (n=681). At week 26, BDP/FF/GB improved pre-dose FEV1 by 0·081 L (95% CI 0·052-0·109; p<0·001) and 2-h post-dose FEV1 by 0·117 L (0·086-0·147; p<0·001) compared with BDP/FF. Mean TDI focal scores at week 26 were 1·71 for BDP/FF/GB and 1·50 for BDP/FF, with a difference of 0·21 (95% CI -0·08 to 0·51; p=0·160). Adjusted annual moderate-to-severe exacerbation frequencies were 0·41 for BDP/FF/GB and 0·53 for BDP/FF (rate ratio 0·77 [95% CI 0·65-0·92]; p=0·005), corresponding to a 23% reduction in exacerbations with BDP/FF/GB compared with BDP/FF. Adverse events were reported by 368 (54%) patients with BDP/FF/GB and 379 (56%) with BDP/FF. One serious treatment-related adverse event occurred (atrial fibrillation) in a patient in the BDP/FF/GB group.

Patients with COPD were also assigned to ELLIPTA vs Handihaler or Breezhaler. Patients demonstrated inhaler use after reading the patient information leaflet (PIL). A trained investigator assessed critical errors (i.e., those likely to result in the inhalation of significantly reduced, minimal or no medication). If the patient made errors, the investigator demonstrated the correct use of the inhaler, and the patient demonstrated inhaler use again. Fewer COPD patients made critical errors with ELLIPTA after reading the PIL vs: DISKUS, 9/171 (5%) vs 75/171 (44%); MDI, 10/80 (13%) vs 48/80 (60%); Turbuhaler, 8/100 (8%) vs 44/100 (44%); Handihaler, 17/118 (14%) vs 57/118 (48%); Breezhaler, 13/98 (13%) vs 45/98 (46%; all P<0.001).

376;27940287;Fast onset of action of glycopyrronium compared with tiotropium in patients with moderate to severe COPD - A randomised, multicentre, crossover trial.;"Background Long-acting bronchodilators, including anticholinergics glycopyrronium and tiotropium, are central to symptomatic management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In patients with moderate to severe COPD, glycopyrronium has demonstrated comparable efficacy to open-label and single-blinded tiotropium, but with faster onset of bronchodilation. The FAST study assessed the efficacy of glycopyrronium compared with tiotropium in serial spirometry and body plethysmography assessments to further characterize the earlier onset of action associated with glycopyrronium. Methods In this German multicentre, randomised, double-blinded, double-dummy, cross-over study, patients with moderate-to-severe COPD received single-dose of glycopyrronium 44 μg and tiotropium 18 μg via the Breezhaler and Handihaler devices, respectively. Primary objective was to demonstrate superiority of glycopyrronium over tiotropium in terms of improvement in forced expiratory volume in 1 s as assessed by the area under the curve from 0 to 2 h (FEV AUC ). Secondary endpoints were functional residual capacity (FRC), residual volume (RV), inspiratory capacity (IC), and specific airway resistance (sR), all measured by body plethysmography. Results Of the 152 patients randomised, 99.3% completed the study. After inhalation of the single dose, glycopyrronium demonstrated superiority over tiotropium in early bronchodilation as assessed by improvement in FEV AUC (least squares mean treatment difference = 37 mL; 95% CI: 16, 59 mL; p < 0.01) and FEV at 15 min post-dose (least square mean treatment difference = 36 mL; 95% CI: 14, 58 mL; p < 0.01). Both treatments showed similar improvements in FRC, RV, and IC. Glycopyrronium showed statistically significant improvement in sR compared with tiotropium over the first 90 min after dosing, with the difference of 0.184 kPa × s at 90 min post-dose (95% CI: 0.315,0.054 kPa × s; p < 0.01). Conclusions Glycopyrronium was superior to tiotropium in terms of early bronchodilation. Although both glycopyrronium and tiotropium showed similar improvements in static lung volume parameters, glycopyrronium reduced specific airway resistance faster than tiotropium, which could in part explain the earlier FEV response seen with glycopyrronium.

We assessed the efficacy and safety of glycopyrrolate (GP)/formoterol fumarate (FF) fixed-dose combination delivered via a Co-Suspension™ Delivery Technology-based metered dose inhaler (MDI) (GFF MDI). Methods This was a Phase IIb randomized, multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind, chronic-dosing (7 days), crossover study in patients with moderate-to-very severe COPD ( NCT01085045 ). Treatments included GFF MDI twice daily (BID) (GP/FF 72/9.6 μg or 36/9.6 μg), GP MDI 36 μg BID, FF MDI 7.2 and 9.6 μg BID, placebo MDI, and open-label formoterol dry powder inhaler (FF DPI) 12 μg BID or tiotropium DPI 18 μg once daily. The primary endpoint was forced expiratory volume in 1 s area under the curve from 0 to 12 h (FEV AUC) on Day 7 relative to baseline FEV. Secondary endpoints included pharmacokinetics and safety. Results GFF MDI 72/9.6 μg or 36/9.6 μg led to statistically significant improvements in FEV AUC after 7 days' treatment versus monocomponent MDIs, placebo MDI, tiotropium, or FF DPI (p ≤ 0.0002). GFF MDI 36/9.6 μg was non-inferior to GFF MDI 72/9.6 μg and monocomponent MDIs were non-inferior to open-label comparators. Pharmacokinetic results showed glycopyrrolate and formoterol exposure were decreased following administration via fixed-dose combination versus monocomponent MDIs; however, this was not clinically meaningful. GFF MDI was well tolerated. Conclusions GFF MDI 72/9.6 μg and 36/9.6 μg BID improve lung function and are well tolerated in patients with moderate-to-very severe COPD.

Methods The FULFIL (Lung Function and Quality of Life Assessment in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease with Closed Triple Therapy) trial was a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy study comparing 24 weeks of once-daily triple therapy (fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol 100 μg/62.5 μg/25 μg; ELLIPTA inhaler) with twice-daily ICS/LABA therapy (budesonide/formoterol 400 μg/12 μg; Turbuhaler). A patient subgroup remained on blinded treatment for up to 52 weeks. Co-primary endpoints were change from baseline in trough FEV and in St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score at Week 24. Measurements and main results In the intent-to-treat population (n = 1,810) at Week 24 for triple therapy (n = 911) and ICS/LABA therapy (n = 899), mean changes from baseline in FEV were 142 ml (95% confidence interval [CI], 126 to 158) and -29 ml (95% CI, -46 to -13), respectively, and mean changes from baseline in SGRQ scores were -6.6 units (95% CI, -7.4 to -5.7) and -4.3 units (95% CI, -5.2 to -3.4), respectively.

The primary endpoint was the ability to perform all steps correctly at the first attempt. Secondary endpoints included the ability to perform all critical steps correctly at the first attempt, the requisite number of attempts to successfully use the inhaler, the ability to be trained within 15 minutes, and the ability to trigger the K-haler BTI to actuate at the first attempt. Ease of device use and device preference versus patients' usual maintenance inhalers were also assessed. Results and conclusions At the first attempt, an identical proportion (77.2% [95% confidence interval [CI]: 72.1, 81.8]) of 307 patients performed all pMDI and K-haler BTI handling steps correctly, whereas the corresponding proportions performing all critical steps correctly were 82.4% (95% CIs: 77.7, 86.5) and 87.0% (95% CI: 82.7, 90.5), respectively. For both devices, >90% of patients required only two attempts to master device usage; >99% of patients could be trained to correctly use each device within 15 minutes. Virtually all patients (99.0% [95% CIs: 97.2, 99.8]) were able to successfully trigger the K-haler BTI's dose-release mechanism at first attempt. Ease of use and preference data for FP/FORM pMDI challenged the perceived wisdom that dry powder inhalers are necessarily simpler to use, whereas the corresponding data for FP/FORM K-haler strongly favored this novel BTI over the Turbuhaler, Accuhaler, and other pMDIs.";Respiratory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Test
383;28737971;Fluticasone Furoate, Vilanterol, and Lung Function Decline in Patients with Moderate Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease and Heightened Cardiovascular Risk.;"Rationale Many patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have an accelerated loss of lung function. It is unclear whether drug treatment can modify this in patients with moderately severe disease. Objectives In a prespecified analysis of the key secondary outcome in SUMMIT (Study to Understand Mortality and Morbidity), we investigated whether the inhaled corticosteroid fluticasone furoate (FF; 100 μg), the long-acting β-agonist vilanterol (VI; 25 μg), or their combination (FF/VI) modified the rate of decline in FEV compared with placebo. We also investigated how baseline covariates affected this decline. Methods Spirometry was measured every 12 weeks in this event-driven, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of 16,485 patients with moderate COPD and heightened cardiovascular risk. An average of seven spirometric assessments per subject among the 15,457 patients with at least one on-treatment measurement were used in the analysis of rate of FEV decline. All statistical comparisons are considered nominal. Measurements and main results The adjusted rates of FEV decline were -46 ml/yr (-3.0% of baseline) with placebo, -47 ml/yr (-3.1%) with VI, -38 ml/yr (-2.5%) with FF, and -38 ml/yr (-2.3%) with FF/VI. FF-containing regimens had lower rates of decline than placebo (P < 0.03), and FF/VI had a lower rate of decline than VI alone (P < 0.005). The FEV decline was faster in current smokers, those with a lower body mass index, males, and patients with established cardiovascular disease. Conclusions In patients with moderate COPD and heightened cardiovascular risk, FF alone or in combination with VI appears to reduce the rate of FEV decline.

384;28877027;Tiotropium in Early-Stage Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.;"Background Patients with mild or moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) rarely receive medications, because they have few symptoms. We hypothesized that long-term use of tiotropium would improve lung function and ameliorate the decline in lung function in patients with mild or moderate COPD. Methods In a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that was conducted in China, we randomly assigned 841 patients with COPD of Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) stage 1 (mild) or 2 (moderate) severity to receive a once-daily inhaled dose (18 μg) of tiotropium (419 patients) or matching placebo (422) for 2 years. The primary end point was the between-group difference in the change from baseline to 24 months in the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV) before bronchodilator use. Secondary end points included the between-group difference in the change from baseline to 24 months in the FEV after bronchodilator use and the between-group difference in the annual decline in the FEV before and after bronchodilator use from day 30 to month 24. Results Of 841 patients who underwent randomization, 388 patients in the tiotropium group and 383 in the placebo group were included in the full analysis set. The FEV in patients who received tiotropium was higher than in those who received placebo throughout the trial (ranges of mean differences, 127 to 169 ml before bronchodilator use and 71 to 133 ml after bronchodilator use; P<0.001 for all comparisons). There was no significant amelioration of the mean (±SE) annual decline in the FEV before bronchodilator use: the decline was 38±6 ml per year in the tiotropium group and 53±6 ml per year in the placebo group (difference, 15 ml per year; 95% confidence interval [CI], -1 to 31; P=0.06). In contrast, the annual decline in the FEV after bronchodilator use was significantly less in the tiotropium group than in the placebo group (29±5 ml per year vs. 51±6 ml per year; difference, 22 ml per year [95% CI, 6 to 37]; P=0.006). The incidence of adverse events was generally similar in the two groups. Conclusions Tiotropium resulted in a higher FEV than placebo at 24 months and ameliorated the annual decline in the FEV after bronchodilator use in patients with COPD of GOLD stage 1 or 2.

The GOLDEN 5 Phase III, randomized, active-controlled, open-label study was conducted to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of a nebulized glycopyrrolate formulation (SUN-101) delivered via the investigational eFlow Closed System (eFlow CS) nebulizer in subjects with moderate-to-very-severe COPD. Methods Subjects were randomized in a 4:3 ratio to nebulized glycopyrrolate 50 μg twice daily (BID) or tiotropium 18 μg once daily (OD) and treated for 48 weeks. Subjects represented the general COPD population with real-world characteristics including severe disease, presence of comorbidities, and receiving background COPD therapy. Primary endpoints were the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), serious TEAEs, and discontinuations due to TEAEs. Secondary endpoints included the number of subjects with major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE); change from baseline in trough forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV), and assessment of patient-reported outcomes. Results 1086 subjects received at least one dose of study drug. The overall incidence of TEAEs was comparable for subjects treated with glycopyrrolate (69.4%) or tiotropium (67.0%). Serious TEAEs occurred at similar rates in both treatment groups (glycopyrrolate, 12.3%; tiotropium, 10.5%). The most frequent TEAEs were COPD exacerbation/worsening and cough. Discontinuation due to TEAEs was higher in the glycopyrrolate group (10.0%) than the tiotropium group (2.8%) and related, in part, to the open-label study design, prior use of long-acting muscarinic antagonists and aerosol-airway interactions. Fewer subjects in the glycopyrrolate group experienced MACE (glycopyrrolate, n = 3 [0.5%]; tiotropium, n = 8 [1.7%]). Nebulized glycopyrrolate treatment resulted in improvements in trough FEV that were maintained over 48 weeks. Patient-reported health outcomes showed improvements, supporting the increases in trough FEV. Conclusions Treatment with nebulized glycopyrrolate was well tolerated over 48 weeks with the most common adverse events being COPD worsening and cough. The overall and cardiac safety and tolerability profile and improvements in pulmonary function and patient-reported health outcomes support the use of nebulized glycopyrrolate as a maintenance treatment for moderate-to-very-severe COPD.

386;29227727;A Randomized Clinical Trial Comparing the ELLIPTA and HandiHaler Dry Powder Inhalers in Patients With COPD: Inhaler-Specific Attributes and Overall Patient Preference.;"This randomised, open-label, cross-over, placebo-containing inhaler study assessed patient preference indicators for ELLIPTA and HandiHaler dry powder inhalers in patients with COPD (NCT02786927; GSK identifier: 204983). The primary objective of this study was to assess patient preference between ELLIPTA and HandiHaler based on the number of steps needed to use the inhaler. Eligible patients ≥40 years of age with COPD were randomised 1:1 to receive their current COPD medication plus a placebo-containing ELLIPTA or HandiHaler inhaler once daily for 7 ± 2 days (treatment period 1); this was followed by a 7 ± 2-day placebo treatment with the alternative inhaler. A 5-item questionnaire assessed inhaler-related patient preferences. A total of 212 patients (mean age, 65.1 years) were enrolled at 22 US sites; 73% had a COPD duration ≥5 years. Median (range) exposure was 8 ( 5 , 13 ) days for ELLIPTA and 8 ( 1 , 16) days for HandiHaler. Significantly more patients preferred ELLIPTA to HandiHaler in terms of the number of steps to use and all secondary attributes (size, comfort of the mouthpiece, remaining doses, and ease of use of the two inhalers; all p < 0.001). Similar results were observed irrespective of the order of inhaler use. Eighteen patients (8%) reported at least one AE and two (<1%) patients reported four non-fatal SAEs; none were related to the study treatment. Patient attitude toward a particular inhaler and their experiences in using it can affect adherence to therapy, which can in turn strongly influence effectiveness of inhaled medications.

We evaluated the non-inferiority of single-inhaler FF/UMEC/VI versus FF/VI + UMEC using two inhalers. Methods Eligible patients with COPD (aged ≥40 years; ≥1 moderate/severe exacerbation in the 12 months before screening) were randomized (1:1; stratified by the number of long-acting bronchodilators [0, 1 or 2] per day during run-in) to receive 24-week FF/UMEC/VI 100/62.5/25 μg and placebo or FF/VI 100/25 μg + UMEC 62.5 μg; all treatments/placebo were delivered using the ELLIPTA inhaler once-daily in the morning. Primary endpoint: change from baseline in trough forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV) at Week 24. The non-inferiority margin for the lower 95% confidence limit was set at - 50 mL. Results A total of 1055 patients (844 [80%] of whom were enrolled on combination maintenance therapy) were randomized to receive FF/UMEC/VI (n = 527) or FF/VI + UMEC (n = 528). Mean change from baseline in trough FEV at Week 24 was 113 mL (95% CI 91, 135) for FF/UMEC/VI and 95 mL (95% CI 72, 117) for FF/VI + UMEC; the between-treatment difference of 18 mL (95% CI -13, 50) confirmed FF/UMEC/VI's was considered non-inferior to FF/VI + UMEC. At Week 24, the proportion of responders based on St George's Respiratory Questionnaire Total score was 50% (FF/UMEC/VI) and 51% (FF/VI + UMEC); the proportion of responders based on the Transitional Dyspnea Index focal score was similar (56% both groups). A similar proportion of patients experienced a moderate/severe exacerbation in the FF/UMEC/VI (24%) and FF/VI + UMEC (27%) groups; the hazard ratio for time to first moderate/severe exacerbation with FF/UMEC/VI versus FF/VI + UMEC was 0.87 (95% CI 0.68, 1.12). The incidence of adverse events was comparable in both groups (48%); the incidence of serious adverse events was 10% (FF/UMEC/VI) and 11% (FF/VI + UMEC). Conclusions Single-inhaler triple therapy (FF/UMEC/VI) is non-inferior to two inhalers (FF/VI + UMEC) on trough FEV change from baseline at 24 weeks.

388;29429593;Extrafine inhaled triple therapy versus dual bronchodilator therapy in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (TRIBUTE): a double-blind, parallel group, randomised controlled trial.;Background Evidence is scarce on the relative risk-benefit of inhaled triple therapy, consisting of inhaled corticosteroid, long-acting muscarinic antagonist, and long-acting β-agonist, versus dual bronchodilation for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We aimed to compare a single-inhaler triple combination of beclometasone dipropionate, formoterol fumarate, and glycopyrronium (BDP/FF/G) versus a single-inhaler dual bronchodilator combination of indacaterol plus glycopyrronium (IND/GLY) in terms of the rate of moderate-to-severe COPD exacerbations over 52 weeks of treatment. Methods This randomised, parallel-group, double-blind, double-dummy study was done at 187 sites across 17 countries. Eligible patients had symptomatic COPD, severe or very severe airflow limitation, at least one moderate or severe exacerbation in the previous year, and were receiving inhaled maintenance medication. After a 2 week run-in period with one inhalation per day of IND/GLY (85 μg/43 μg), patients were randomly assigned (1:1), via an interactive response technology system, to receive 52 weeks of treatment with two inhalations of extrafine BDP/FF/G (87 μg/5 μg/9 μg) twice per day or one inhalation of IND/GLY (85 μg/43 μg) per day. Randomisation was stratified by country and severity of airflow limitation. The primary endpoint was the rate of moderate-to-severe COPD exacerbations across 52 weeks of treatment in all randomised patients who received at least one dose of study drug and had at least one post-baseline efficacy assessment. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02579850. Findings Between May, 29 2015, and July 10, 2017, 1532 patients received BDP/FF/G (n=764) or IND/GLY (n=768). Moderate-to-severe exacerbation rates were 0·50 per patient per year (95% CI 0·45-0·57) for BDP/FF/G and 0·59 per patient per year (0·53-0·67) for IND/GLY, giving a rate ratio of 0·848 (0·723-0·995, p=0·043) in favour of BDP/FF/G. Adverse events were reported by 490 (64%) of 764 patients receiving BDP/FF/G and 516 (67%) of 768 patients receiving IND/GLY. Pneumonia occurred in 28 (4%) patients receiving BDP/FF/G versus 27 (4%) patients receiving IND/GLY. One treatment-related serious adverse event occurred in each group: dysuria in a patient receiving BDP/FF/G and atrial fibrillation in a patient receiving IND/GLY. Interpretation In patients with symptomatic COPD, severe or very severe airflow limitation, and an exacerbation history despite maintenance therapy, extrafine BDP/FF/G significantly reduced the rate of moderate-to-severe exacerbations compared with IND/GLY, without increasing the risk of pneumonia.

389;29439648;Effect of 12 weeks of once-daily tiotropium/olodaterol on exercise endurance during constant work-rate cycling and endurance shuttle walking in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.;Background The TORRACTO study evaluated the effects of tiotropium/olodaterol versus placebo on endurance time during constant work-rate cycling and constant speed shuttle walking in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) after 12 weeks of treatment. Methods The effects of once-daily tiotropium/olodaterol (2.5/5 and 5/5 μg) on endurance time during constant work-rate cycle ergometry (CWRCE) after 6 and 12 weeks of treatment were compared with placebo in patients with COPD in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trial. Endurance time during the endurance shuttle walk test (ESWT) after 6 and 12 weeks of treatment was also evaluated in a subset of patients. Results A total of 404 patients received treatment, with 165 participating in the ESWT substudy. A statistically significant improvement in endurance time during CWRCE was observed after 12 weeks (primary endpoint) with tiotropium/olodaterol 5/5 µg [14% ( p = 0.02)] but not with tiotropium/olodaterol 2.5/5 µg [9% ( p = 0.14)] versus placebo. In the ESWT substudy, a trend to improvement in endurance time during ESWT after 12 weeks (key secondary endpoint) was observed with tiotropium/olodaterol 5/5 µg [21% ( p = 0.055)] and tiotropium/olodaterol 2.5/5 µg [21% ( p = 0.056)] versus placebo. Conclusion Tiotropium/olodaterol 5/5 µg improved endurance time during cycle ergometry versus placebo, with a strong tendency to also improve walking endurance time.

390;29506504;A phase IIb randomized, chronic-dosing, incomplete block, cross-over study of glycopyrronium, delivered via metered dose inhaler, compared with a placebo and an active control in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD.;Background Long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) and long-acting β-agonist (LABA) bronchodilators are key to the pharmacologic treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This Phase IIb study investigated the safety and efficacy of four doses of the LAMA glycopyrronium (GP) delivered using co-suspension delivery technology via metered dose inhaler (MDI). The study was part of a wider clinical trial program performed to determine the optimal dose of GP MDI, the LABA formoterol fumarate dihydrate (FF) MDI, and glycopyrronium/formoterol fumarate dihydrate (GFF) MDI fixed-dose combination to be taken forward into Phase III studies. Methods In this randomized, double-blind, 7-day chronic-dosing, three-period incomplete block, cross-over study, patients with moderate-to-severe COPD received two of the four doses of GP MDI (28.8 μg, 14.4 μg, 7.2 μg, and 3.6 μg) twice daily (BID), and either placebo MDI BID or open-label ipratropium MDI 34 μg four times daily. The primary efficacy endpoint was forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV) area under the curve from 0 to 12 h (AUC) relative to baseline on Day 7. Secondary and exploratory efficacy endpoints were assessed on Days 1 and 7. Safety and tolerability were evaluated throughout the study. Results All GP MDI treatments were superior to placebo MDI for the primary efficacy endpoint (all p < 0.0001). However, only GP MDI 28.8 μg and 14.4 μg demonstrated statistical superiority to placebo MDI for all secondary efficacy endpoints analyzed in this study, with the exception of GP MDI 14.4 μg versus placebo MDI for the proportion of patients achieving ≥12% improvement in FEV. No nominally significant differences were observed between GP MDI 28.8 μg and GP MDI 14.4 μg for any of the endpoints. All doses of GP MDI were well tolerated, with no unexpected safety findings. Conclusions This study indicated that there was no advantage of GP MDI 28.8 μg compared with GP MDI 14.4 μg. It therefore added to the evidence from the Phase I/II clinical trial program, which identified GP MDI 14.4 μg as the most appropriate dose for use in the Phase III clinical studies.

This randomized, Phase I, single-dose, six-treatment, four-period, crossover study (NCT01980615) examined the pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety profile of three doses of BGF MDI (320/14.4/10 μg [equivalent to budesonide/glycopyrrolate/formoterol fumarate 320/18/9.6 μg], 160/14.4/10 μg and 80/14.4/10 μg), two doses of a budesonide/formoterol fumarate dihydrate fixed-dose combination (BUD/FORM MDI 320/9 μg and 160/9 μg; not using co-suspension delivery technology) and a glycopyrronium/formoterol fumarate dihydrate co-suspension delivery technology MDI (GFF MDI 14.4/10 μg) in healthy volunteers (18-45 years of age). PK parameters included area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 12 h (AUC), AUC up to the last measurable concentration (AUC), maximum plasma concentration (C) and time to maximum plasma concentration (t). Safety was monitored throughout the study. Of 84 subjects randomized, 76 completed the study. BGF MDI 320/14.4/10 μg was bioequivalent to BUD/FORM MDI 320/9 μg for budesonide for C, AUC and AUC (primary objective). Dose proportionality was observed for the budesonide component between BGF MDI 80/14.4/10 μg and BGF MDI 160/14.4/10 μg, and between BGF MDI 160/14.4/10 μg and BGF MDI 320/14.4/10 μg. Systemic exposure to glycopyrronium and formoterol after BGF MDI 320/14.4/10 μg treatment was similar to GFF MDI 14.4/10 μg. The rate of adverse events was 3.7-17.9% across treatments without any serious adverse events. In conclusion, BGF MDI 320/14.4/10 μg had a similar budesonide PK profile to BUD/FORM MDI 320/9 μg. No PK drug-drug interactions were observed when budesonide was added to glycopyrronium and formoterol fumarate dihydrate. These data support the use of budesonide 320 μg and 160 μg in future clinical trials of BGF MDI in COPD.";Respiratory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Test

Results Seventy healthy volunteers were randomized in the TQT study. GFF MDI 144/38.4, GFF MDI 18/9.6 and GP MDI 144 μg all met the confidence interval-based criteria for negative QT prolongation potential.

It is unclear whether combining olodaterol, a long-acting beta-agonist, with tiotropium, a long-acting anti-muscarinic, reduces the rate of exacerbations compared with tiotropium alone. Methods This 52-week, double-blind, randomised, parallel-group, active-controlled trial randomly assigned (1:1) patients with COPD with a history of exacerbations using a randomised block design to receive tiotropium-olodaterol 5 μg-5 μg or tiotropium 5 μg once daily. Patients using inhaled corticosteroids continued this therapy. Treatment was masked to patients, investigators, and those involved in analysing the data. The primary endpoint was the rate of moderate and severe COPD exacerbations from the first dose of medication until 1 day after last drug administration. The primary analysis included all randomly assigned patients who received any dose of study medication but were not from a site excluded due to on-site protocol violations.

Methods In this randomized trial involving 10,355 patients with COPD, we compared 52 weeks of a once-daily combination of fluticasone furoate (an inhaled glucocorticoid) at a dose of 100 μg, umeclidinium (a LAMA) at a dose of 62.5 μg, and vilanterol (a LABA) at a dose of 25 μg (triple therapy) with fluticasone furoate-vilanterol (at doses of 100 μg and 25 μg, respectively) and umeclidinium-vilanterol (at doses of 62.5 μg and 25 μg, respectively). Each regimen was administered in a single Ellipta inhaler. The primary outcome was the annual rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations during treatment. Results The rate of moderate or severe exacerbations in the triple-therapy group was 0.91 per year, as compared with 1.07 per year in the fluticasone furoate-vilanterol group (rate ratio with triple therapy, 0.85; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.80 to 0.90; 15% difference; P<0.001) and 1.21 per year in the umeclidinium-vilanterol group (rate ratio with triple therapy, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.70 to 0.81; 25% difference; P<0.001). The annual rate of severe exacerbations resulting in hospitalization in the triple-therapy group was 0.13, as compared with 0.19 in the umeclidinium-vilanterol group (rate ratio, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.56 to 0.78; 34% difference; P<0.001). There was a higher incidence of pneumonia in the inhaled-glucocorticoid groups than in the umeclidinium-vilanterol group, and the risk of clinician-diagnosed pneumonia was significantly higher with triple therapy than with umeclidinium-vilanterol, as assessed in a time-to-first-event analysis (hazard ratio, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.22 to 1.92; P<0.001). Conclusions Triple therapy with fluticasone furoate, umeclidinium, and vilanterol resulted in a lower rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations than fluticasone furoate-vilanterol or umeclidinium-vilanterol in this population. Triple therapy also resulted in a lower rate of hospitalization due to COPD than umeclidinium-vilanterol.

395;29695902;Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of three doses of co-suspension delivery technology glycopyrronium MDI in Japanese patients with moderate-to-severe COPD.;"Purpose Due to the burden of COPD in Japan, new pharmacologic treatments are needed to meet patient requirements. This study assessed the efficacy and safety of glycopyrronium (GP) delivered via metered dose inhaler (MDI) in Japanese patients with moderate-to-severe COPD. Methods This Phase IIb, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, 7-day, crossover study compared GP MDI 28.8, 14.4, and 7.2 μg with placebo MDI (all administered as two inhalations, twice daily). The primary endpoint was change from baseline in morning pre-dose trough forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV) on Day 8. Secondary endpoints included FEV area under the curve from 0 to 2 hours (AUC) and peak change from baseline in FEV on Days 1 and 8 and forced vital capacity AUC on Day 8. Safety was also assessed. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03256552; http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov. Results Sixty-six patients were randomized and 62 were included in the modified intent-to-treat population (mean age 67.5 years). All three GP MDI doses significantly improved change from baseline in morning pre-dose trough FEV on Day 8 compared with placebo MDI (least squares mean differences 108-131 mL; all <0.0001). Significant improvements in secondary efficacy endpoints were also observed for all three GP MDI doses compared with placebo MDI (all <0.0001). Dose-response plateaued at GP MDI 14.4 μg. No significant safety findings were observed with any GP MDI dose or placebo MDI. Conclusions The results of this study suggest that GP MDI 14.4 μg (7.2 μg per inhalation) is the most appropriate dose for use in Phase III studies in Japanese patients with moderate-to-severe COPD.";Respiratory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train
396;29898702;Comparison of peak inspiratory flow rate via the Breezhaler®, Ellipta® and HandiHaler® dry powder inhalers in patients with moderate to very severe COPD: a randomized cross-over trial.;Background The chronic and progressive nature of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) requires self-administration of inhaled medication. Dry powder inhalers (DPIs) are increasingly being used for inhalation therapy in COPD. Important considerations when selecting DPIs include inhalation effort required and flow rates achieved by patients. Here, we present the comparison of the peak inspiratory flow rate (PIF) values achieved by COPD patients, with moderate to very severe airflow limitation, through the Breezhaler®, the Ellipta® and the HandiHaler® inhalers. The effects of disease severity, age and gender on PIF rate were also evaluated. Methods This randomized, open-label, multicenter, cross-over, Phase IV study recruited patients with moderate to very severe airflow limitation (Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease 2014 strategy), aged ≥40 years and having a smoking history of ≥10 pack years. No active drug or placebo was administered during the study. The inhalation profiles were recorded using inhalers fitted with a pressure tap and transducer at the wall of the mouthpiece. For each patient, the inhalation with the highest PIF value, out of three replicate inhalations per device, was selected for analysis. A paired t-test was performed to compare mean PIFs between each combination of devices. Results In total, 97 COPD patients were enrolled and completed the study. The highest mean PIF value (L/min ± SE) was observed with the Breezhaler® (108 ± 23), followed by the Ellipta® (78 ± 15) and the HandiHaler® (49 ± 9) inhalers and the lowest mean pressure drop values were recorded with the Breezhaler® inhaler, followed by the Ellipta® inhaler and the HandiHaler® inhaler, in the overall patient population. A similar trend was consistently observed in patients across all subgroups of COPD severity, within all age groups and for both genders. Conclusions Patients with COPD were able to inhale with the least inspiratory effort and generate the highest mean PIF value through the Breezhaler® inhaler when compared with the Ellipta® and the HandiHaler® inhalers. These results were similar irrespective of patients' COPD severity, age or gender.

397;29950826;Efficacy and safety of four doses of glycopyrrolate/formoterol fumarate delivered via a metered dose inhaler compared with the monocomponents in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD.;"Purpose To determine the efficacy and safety of glycopyrrolate/formoterol fumarate metered dose inhaler (GFF MDI 36/9.6, 36/7.2, 18/9.6, 9/9.6 µg) using innovative co-suspension delivery technology, compared with glycopyrrolate (GP) MDI 36 µg and formoterol fumarate (FF) MDI 9.6 µg, in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD. Methods In this Phase IIb, randomized, double-blind, balanced incomplete-block, two-period, cross-over study (NCT01349816), patients received treatment twice-daily for 7 days. The primary efficacy endpoint was forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV) area under the curve from 0 to 12 hours (AUC) on Day 7. Secondary efficacy endpoints were peak change from baseline in FEV through 2 hours; time to onset of action (≥10% improvement in mean FEV); proportion of patients achieving ≥12% improvement in FEV on Day 1; peak change from baseline in inspiratory capacity (IC) on Days 1 and 7; change from baseline in morning pre-dose FEV; peak change from baseline in FEV through 6 hours; and change from baseline in mean evening 12-hour post-dose trough FEV on Day 7. Safety was assessed. Results All 185 randomized patients received treatment. All doses of GFF MDI significantly improved the primary endpoint compared with GP MDI 36 µg (all ≤0.0137). For peak change in FEV and IC and time to onset of action secondary endpoints, ≥2 doses of GFF MDI demonstrated superiority to GP MDI 36 µg. No significant differences were observed between GFF MDI and FF MDI 9.6 µg for primary and secondary endpoints. The incidence of adverse events was similar between treatments. Conclusion While all doses of GFF MDI were superior to GP MDI 36 µg for the primary end-point, in this study neither superiority of GFF MDI to FF MDI 9.6 µg nor a clear dose-response was observed. All treatments were well tolerated with no unexpected safety findings.";Respiratory system diseases;Interventional;Indomain;Train
398;30174421;A randomized, open-label, single-visit, crossover study simulating triple-drug delivery with Ellipta compared with dual inhaler combinations in patients with COPD.;"Background Administering maintenance COPD therapy with a combination of multiple inhalers may increase inhaler errors. This study evaluated the potential benefits of using a single Ellipta dry powder inhaler (DPI) compared with two combinations of DPIs commonly used to deliver triple maintenance therapy. Methods Patients receiving inhaled COPD medication were enrolled in this multicenter, randomized, open-label, placebo-device, crossover study with a 2×2 complete block design (NCT0298218), which comprised two substudies: Ellipta vs Diskus + HandiHaler (substudy 1) or Turbuhaler + HandiHaler (substudy 2). Patients demonstrated inhaler use after reading the relevant patient information leaflet (PIL). A trained investigator assessed user errors (critical errors [errors likely to result in no or significantly reduced medication being inhaled] and overall errors). The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients making ≥1 critical error after reading the PIL. The secondary endpoints included error rates during ≤2 reassessments following investigator instruction (if required), instruction time, and patient preference. Results After reading the PIL, significantly fewer patients made critical errors with Ellipta compared with Diskus + HandiHaler (9% [7/80] vs 75% [60/80], respectively; <0.001) or Turbuhaler + HandiHaler (9% [7/79] vs 73% [58/79], respectively; <0.001). The number of patients making overall errors was also lower with Ellipta vs tested inhaler combinations (<0.001 for each substudy). The median instruction time needed for error-free use was shorter with Ellipta in substudies 1 and 2 (2.7 and 2.6 minutes, respectively) vs either combination (10.6 [Diskus + HandiHaler] and 11.3 minutes [Turbuhaler + HandiHaler], respectively). Significantly more patients preferred Ellipta over Diskus + HandiHaler or Turbuhaler + HandiHaler overall for taking their COPD medication (81% vs 9% and 84% vs 4%, respectively) and per the number of steps for taking their COPD medication (89% vs 8% and 91% vs 5%, respectively).

399;30310273;Improved lung function and patient-reported outcomes with co-suspension delivery technology glycopyrrolate/formoterol fumarate metered dose inhaler in COPD: a randomized Phase III study conducted in Asia, Europe, and the USA.;"Background COPD is a major global cause of mortality and morbidity. PINNACLE-4 evaluated the efficacy and safety of GFF MDI (glycopyrrolate/formoterol fumarate metered dose inhaler) in patients from Asia, Europe, and the USA with moderate-to-very severe COPD. Methods In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase III study, patients were randomized to treatment with GFF MDI 18/9.6 μg, glycopyrrolate (GP) MDI 18 μg, formoterol fumarate (FF) MDI 9.6 μg, or placebo MDI (all twice daily) for 24 weeks. Lung function, patient-reported outcomes (symptoms and health-related quality of life), and safety were assessed. Results Of the 1,756 patients randomized, 1,740 patients were included in the intent-to-treat population (mean age 64.2 years, 74.1% male, and 40.2% Asian). GFF MDI significantly improved morning predose trough FEV at Week 24 (primary endpoint) vs placebo MDI, GP MDI, and FF MDI (least squares mean differences: 165, 59, and 72 mL, respectively; all <0.0001). GFF MDI also significantly improved other lung function endpoints vs placebo MDI, GP MDI, and FF MDI and patient-reported outcomes vs placebo MDI and GP MDI. A larger proportion of patients treated with GFF MDI achieved the minimum clinically important difference in Transition Dyspnea Index score vs GP MDI and placebo MDI and in St George's Respiratory Questionnaire score vs placebo MDI. Adverse event rates were similar across treatment groups. Conclusion These results demonstrated the efficacy of GFF MDI in patients with moderate-to-very severe COPD.

400;11320043;A trial of recombinant human granulocyte colony stimulating factor for the treatment of very low birthweight infants with presumed sepsis and neutropenia.;"Objectives. The primary objective was to investigate the safety of recombinant human granulocyte colony stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) for the treatment of very low birthweight infants (VLBW) with sepsis and relative neutropenia, specifically with regard to worsening of respiratory distress and thrombocytopenia and all cause mortality. Secondary objectives were to evaluate duration of ventilation, intensive care, and antibiotic use as markers of efficacy. Design. Neonates (< or = 28 days) in intensive care, with birth weights of 500-1500 g, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of < or = 5 x 10(9)/l, and clinical evidence of sepsis, were randomly assigned to receive either rhG-CSF (10 microg/kg/day) administered intravenously (n = 13), or placebo (n = 15) for a maximum of 14 days, in addition to standard treatment and antibiotics. All adverse events, oxygenation index, incidence of thrombocytopenia, all cause mortality, duration of ventilation, intensive care and antibiotic treatment, and ANC recovery were compared between the two groups. Results. Adverse events and oxygenation index were not increased by, and thrombocytopenia was not attributable to, treatment with rhG-CSF. At 6 and 12 months postmenstrual age, there were significantly fewer deaths in the group receiving rhG-CSF (1/13 v 7/15; p < or = 0.038). There was a non-significant trend towards a reduction in duration of ventilation, intensive care, and antibiotic use in the rhG-CSF group. There was a significantly more rapid increase in ANC in the rhG-CSF treated babies (p < 0.001). Conclusions. In a small randomised placebo controlled trial in a highly selected group of neonates, adjuvant treatment with rhG-CSF increased ANC rapidly, and no treatment related adverse events were identified. Mortality at 6 and 12 months postmenstrual age was significantly lower in the treatment group. A large trial investigating efficacy in a similar group of neonates is warranted.";Blood or blood-forming organ diseases;Interventional;Indication out-of-domain;Test
401;11892704;Effectiveness of leukocyte interferon in patients affected by HCV-positive mixed cryoglobulinemia resistant to recombinant alpha-interferon.;"Objective. Interferon is the first-choice therapy for HCV-positive mixed cryoglobulinemia, but only a small fraction of the patients show long-term recovery from the disease. In non-responders or relapsers, the second-line therapy (high dose interferon) generally is not effective. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of leukocyte interferon as a second-line therapy in patients who are non-responders or relapsers to a first course of recombinant interferon. Methods. Twenty-eight patients with HCV-positive mixed cryoglobulinemia were enrolled. In each case the HCV-RNA and HCV genotype, as well as the usual laboratory parameters, were determined before, at the end of therapy and 1 year after the end of therapy. All patients were treated following the same schedule: leukocyte interferon 3,000,000 three times a week for one year. Results. Only 5 patients obtained complete recovery from viral infection as well as from all signs and symptoms of the disease. Most patients (80%) experienced relief from clinical symptoms without recovery from HCV replication. Responders to the second interferon course were ""relapsers"" to the first treatment. No patient considered as a ""non-responder"" showed complete remission from the disease after the second treatment. Conclusions. A second leukocyte interferon course could be useful for patients affected by mixed crvoglobulinemia who relapsed after a first course of recombinant interferon therapy.";Blood or blood-forming organ diseases;Interventional;Indication out-of-domain;Test

To investigate if oral use of Sorbifer Durules (EGIS Pharmaceutical Ltd, Budapest, Hungary) (1 tablet/d) is adequate for the maintenance of serum iron and vitamin C in normal range during recombinant human erythropoietin treatment in hemodialyzed patients. One tablet of Sorbifer Durules contains 100 mg of Fe(2+) and 60 mg of vitamin C. Design. Short-term, open-label clinical trial. Setting. Hemodialysis units. Patients. Twenty-four adult patients with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis. Intervention. Four-week treatment period of Sorbifer Durules, preceded and followed by iron and vitamin C washout periods. Main outcome measure. Fasting predialysis serum samples were collected on days 0, 28, 56, and 84 to determine hematocrit, blood hemoglobin, serum iron, total iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation, ferritin, vitamin C, and plasma oxalate. Results. Four-week treatment in hemodialyzed patients by Sorbifer Durules led to significant increase of hematocrit, blood hemoglobin, serum iron and vitamin C. This treatment did not influence the level of plasma oxalate. Conclusion. Oral dose of one tablet of Sorbifer Durules per day is adequate for the maintenance of serum iron in normal range during recombinant human erythropoietin treatment in hemodialyzed patients. This treatment simultaneously prevented the development of serum vitamin C deficiency and did not lead to further increase of plasma oxalate in these patients.;Blood or blood-forming organ diseases;Interventional;Indication out-of-domain;Test

We studied 253 patients with acute painful crisis but with no other complications of SCA, randomized to treatment or control groups. In the treatment group, 127 patients received tinzaparin at 175 IU/kg, subcutaneous once daily, along with supportive care including morphine analgesia; in the control group, 126 patients received placebo and the same supportive care. The maximal experimental treatment period was seven days. Analysis revealed a statistically significant reduction in number of days with the severest pain score, overall duration of painful crisis, and duration of hospitalization (p < 0.05 for each comparison of tinzaparin vs. placebo). The decline in pain intensity was sharper for tinzaparin-treated patients, and complications consisted of two minor bleeding events that were reported and treated by cessation of tinzaparin.

404;18583285;The role of clopidogrel and acetylsalicylic acid in the prevention of early-phase graft occlusion due to reactive thrombocytosis after coronary artery bypass operation.;"Background. Reactive thrombocytosis has been reported in 20% of patients after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), a frequency that might be related to the high incidence of thrombotic complications. The present study was planned to investigate the effect of combined treatment with clopidogrel and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) on post-CABG reactive thrombocytosis. Methods. Included in this prospective, randomized study were 60 patients who underwent CABG operation with a 6-month follow-up. Three study groups were defined: group 1 (n = 20), a control group of patients who have not developed reactive thrombocytosis after CABG surgery; group 2 (n = 20), patients who have developed reactive thrombocytosis and continue taking ASA (300 mg/day); and group 3 (n = 20), patients who have developed reactive thrombocytosis and continue taking ASA (300 mg/day) with the addition of clopidogrel (75 mg/day). Results. The mean ages and sex distributions of the patient groups were similar. There were no significant differences between the groups regarding cardiovascular risk factors, baseline laboratory findings, or intraoperative characteristics. Thrombocytosis disappeared within the first month after the operation in both treatment groups. An evaluation of graft patency in the sixth postoperative month revealed that group 2 had significantly more patients with a ""positive"" result in the exercise test than group 3 and that group 3 had a lower incidence of graft occlusion than group 2 (P < .01). Conclusions. Combination antiplatelet therapy with ASA and clopidogrel seems to be more effective than ASA alone for maintaining graft patency in patients with reactive thrombocytosis.";Blood or blood-forming organ diseases;Interventional;Indication out-of-domain;Test

The NHLBI-sponsored Phase III multicenter randomized clinical trial stroke with transfusions changing to hydroxyurea (SWiTCH) (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00122980) compared continuation of chronic blood transfusion/iron chelation to switching to hydroxyurea/phlebotomy for secondary stroke prevention and management of iron overload. All randomized children were included in the analysis (intention to treat). The Fisher's Exact test was used to compare the frequency of subjects who experienced at least one SCA-related adverse event (AE) or serious adverse event (SAE) in each arm and to compare event rates. One hundred and thirty three subjects, mean age 13 ± 3.9 years (range 5.2-19.0 years) and mean time of 7 years on chronic transfusion at study entry, were randomized and treated. Numbers of subjects experiencing non-neurological AEs were similar in the two treatment arms, including SCA-related events, SCA pain events, and low rates of acute chest syndrome and infection. However, fewer children continuing transfusion/chelation experienced SAEs (P = 0.012), SCA-related SAEs (P = 0.003), and SCA pain SAEs (P = 0.016) as compared to children on the hydroxyurea/phlebotomy arm. The timing of phlebotomy did not influence SAEs. Older age at baseline predicted having at least 1 SCA pain event. Patients with recurrent neurological events during SWiTCH were not more likely to experience pain. In children with SCA and prior stroke, monthly transfusions and daily iron chelation provided superior protection against acute vaso-occlusive pain SAEs when compared to hydroxyurea and monthly phlebotomy.;Blood or blood-forming organ diseases;Interventional;Indication out-of-domain;Test

The aim of this study was to collect data in France in patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia who required parenteral anticoagulation and for whom other non-heparin anticoagulant therapies were contraindicated including patients with renal failure, cross-reactivity to danaparoid or at high hemorrhagic risk. Methods. A total of 20 patients, of mean age 72 ± 10 years, were enrolled in this open-label, multicenter clinical study. Exploratory statistical data analysis was performed with descriptive interpretation of intra-individual comparisons using simple univariate statistics. Results. The diagnosis of HIT was confirmed in 16 subjects by an independent scientific committee. Fourteen patients (70 %) were in an intensive care unit during the course of the study. Patients were treated with argatroban for a mean duration of 8.5 ± 6.1 days. The mean starting dose of argatroban was 0.77 ± 0.45 μg/kg/min. Platelet recovery was rapid. aPTT and anti-IIa activity assays were used to monitor the dose of argatroban. The mean baseline aPTT value was 45.0 ± 9.8 sec and increased to 78.2 ± 35.8 sec two hours after initiating argatroban. At this time mean argatroban concentration was 0.34 ± 0.16 and 0.61 ± 0.28 μg/ml using ECT and TT measurements, respectively. New and/or extended thromboses were reported in 25 % of patients and major bleedings were documented in 15 %. Six patients died due to their underlying medical condition. Conclusion. Considering its hepatic elimination and its short half-life, argatroban can be considered as a safe therapeutic option in HIT patients at high hemorrhagic risk and with renal failure, particularly in an ICU setting.;Blood or blood-forming organ diseases;Interventional;Indication out-of-domain;Test
407;28423296;Eltrombopag Added to Standard Immunosuppression for Aplastic Anemia.;"Background. Acquired aplastic anemia results from immune-mediated destruction of bone marrow. Immunosuppressive therapies are effective, but reduced numbers of residual stem cells may limit their efficacy. In patients with aplastic anemia that was refractory to immunosuppression, eltrombopag, a synthetic thrombopoietin-receptor agonist, led to clinically significant increases in blood counts in almost half the patients. We combined standard immunosuppressive therapy with eltrombopag in previously untreated patients with severe aplastic anemia. Methods. We enrolled 92 consecutive patients in a prospective phase 1-2 study of immunosuppressive therapy plus eltrombopag. The three consecutively enrolled cohorts differed with regard to the timing of initiation and the duration of the eltrombopag regimen (cohort 1 received eltrombopag from day 14 to 6 months, cohort 2 from day 14 to 3 months, and cohort 3 from day 1 to 6 months). The cohorts were analyzed separately. The primary outcome was complete hematologic response at 6 months. Secondary end points included overall response, survival, relapse, and clonal evolution to myeloid cancer. Results. The rate of complete response at 6 months was 33% in cohort 1, 26% in cohort 2, and 58% in cohort 3. The overall response rates at 6 months were 80%, 87%, and 94%, respectively. The complete and overall response rates in the combined cohorts were higher than in our historical cohort, in which the rate of complete response was 10% and the overall response rate was 66%. At a median follow-up of 2 years, the survival rate was 97%; one patient died during the study from a nonhematologic cause. Marked increases in bone marrow cellularity, CD34+ cell number, and frequency of early hematopoietic progenitors were noted. Rates of relapse and clonal evolution were similar to our historical experience. Severe rashes occurred in two patients, resulting in the early discontinuation of eltrombopag. Conclusions. The addition of eltrombopag to immunosuppressive therapy was associated with markedly higher rates of hematologic response among patients with severe aplastic anemia than in a historical cohort.

408;30176654;Novel Compound Induces Erythropoietin Secretion through Liver Effects in Chronic Kidney Disease Patients and Healthy Volunteers.;Background. TP0463518 is a novel hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor developed to aid in the treatment of anemia associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is expected to increase erythropoietin (EPO) derived from liver. Two phase I studies were conducted in healthy volunteers (HV) and CKD patients undergoing hemodialysis (i.e., HD patients) or those not undergoing dialysis (i.e., ND patients). Methods. Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and safety profiles of TP0463518 were assessed. Forty HV received single oral doses of TP0463518 at 3, 6, 11, 20, and 36 mg or placebo. Twenty ND patients received single doses of TP0463518 at 1, 6, and 11 mg and 9 HD patients received TP0463518 at 1 and 11 mg doses. To identify the source organ of EPO, glycosylation patterns were determined using percentage migrated isoform (PMI) values. Results. Declining renal function slowed elimination of TP0463518 and increased the mean AUC0-∞. ∆Emax of serum EPO in 11-mg groups of HV, ND patients, and HD patients were 24.37 ± 11.37, 201.57 ± 130.34, and 1,324.76 ± 1,189.24 mIU/mL respectively. A strong correlation was -observed between logarithm conversions of ∆Emax and AUC0-∞ with correlation coefficients of 0.945. PMI values of blood after TP0463518 administration were elevated to similar or higher levels in comparison with those of umbilical cord blood, which mainly contains liver-derived EPO. Conclusions. TP0463518 induced dose-dependent EPO production, mainly derived from the liver in HV and CKD patients. These results suggest that TP0463518 is a new strategy for treating anemia in CKD, which can be used regardless of renal functions.;Blood or blood-forming organ diseases;Interventional;Indication out-of-domain;Test

Platelet transfusion is used to prevent hemorrhagic events in patients with thrombocytopenia undergoing invasive procedures, but there are many disadvantages. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of lusutrombopag in patients with chronic liver disease and thrombocytopenia undergoing invasive procedures. Methods. We performed a double-blind, parallel-group, phase 3 study of 96 patients with chronic liver disease and thrombocytopenia (platelet counts below 50,000/μL) undergoing invasive procedures from October 2013 to May 2014 at 81 centers in Japan. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to groups given once-daily lusutrombopag (3 mg) or placebo for up to 7 days. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients not requiring platelet transfusion before the invasive procedure. The protocol-defined response (platelet count 50,000/μL or more with an increase of 20,000/μL or more from baseline) and the time course of the change in platelet count were also evaluated. Adverse events were recorded. Results. The proportions of patients who did not require preoperative platelet transfusion were 79.2% (38/48) in the lusutrombopag group and 12.5% (6/48) in the placebo group (P < .0001). A response was observed in 77.1% (37/48) of patients in the lusutrombopag group and 6.3% (3/48) of patients in the placebo group (P < .0001). In the lusutrombopag group without platelet transfusion, the median platelet count was 50,000/μL or more after 5 days; the mean time to reach the maximum platelet count was 13.4 days; and the number of days (adjusted mean) during which the platelet count was 50,000/μL or more was 21.09 days. Adverse drug reactions were reported in 8.3% of patients in the lusutrombopag group and 2.1% of patients in the placebo group. Two patients (1 per group) had a thrombotic event, but neither were associated with an excessive increase in platelet count (200,000/μL or more). Conclusion.

410;16279894;A prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of endoscopic steroid injection therapy for recalcitrant esophageal peptic strictures.;Background and aims. The aim of the study was to examine whether endoscopic intralesional corticosteroid injection into recalcitrant peptic esophageal strictures reduces the need for repeat stricture dilation. Methods. Patients with a peptic esophageal stricture and recurrent dysphagia having had at least one dilation in the preceding 18 months were enrolled in a prospective randomized, double-blind study comparing steroid and sham injection. After endoscopic confirmation of recurrent stricture, patients were randomized to receive either 0.5 cc/quadrant triamcinolone (40 mg/cc) or sham injection into the stricture followed by balloon dilation of the stricture. Patients were stratified by the number of dilations required in the preceding 18 months, severity of dysphagia, the presence of esophagitis, stricture severity, and prior therapy with a proton-pump inhibitor. Patients and their physicians were blinded to the type of intervention received. Baseline dysphagia questionnaires were completed. Post-procedurally all patients were placed on a standardized proton-pump inhibitor regimen and standardized telephone follow-up questionnaires were completed at 1 wk and at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. The original sample-size calculation of 60 patients could not be met in a timely fashion because of a low incidence of recalcitrant peptic stricture patients. Results. A total of 30 patients were enrolled, 15 in the steroid group (10 men, mean age 66 yr) and 15 in the sham group (11 M, mean age 67 yr). Patients were followed for 1 yr, unless they underwent an antireflux operation or died. Two patients, one per group, died of non-esophageal causes at 1 and 12 months. Four patients had fundoplication, two in each group, unrelated to stricture or dysphagia. Two patients in the steroid group (13%) and nine in the sham group (60%) required repeat dilation (p= 0.011). Conclusions. In patients with recalcitrant peptic esophageal stricture, steroid injection into the stricture combined with acid suppression significantly diminishes both the need for repeat dilation and the average time to repeat dilation compared to sham injection and acid suppression alone.;Digestive system diseases;Interventional;Indication out-of-domain;Test
411;25667217;Effect of Lidocaine on Swallowing During FEES in Patients With Dysphagia.;Purpose. The aims of this study were to assess the effects of 0.2 mL of 4% atomized lidocaine on swallowing and tolerability during Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES). Methods. A single blinded study was conducted with 17 dysphagic patients, who received 4 standardized boluses in 2 sequential FEES exams under 2 conditions: non-anesthetized (decongestant only) and anesthetized (lidocaine 4%+decongestant). After each procedure, patients rated their pain on the Wong Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale. Clinicians scored each swallow with the Penetration Aspiration Scale (PAS) and an author-developed Residue Rating Scale. Because the assessments were ordinal, a series of Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were conducted to detect differences between the 2 conditions. Results. No significant differences were detected between groups on PAS or residue in the 4 boluses. Pain scores, however, were significantly lower in the anesthetized condition than the decongested-only condition (P=.035). Conclusion. The findings of this study indicated that 0.2 mL of 4% lidocaine enhanced exam tolerability and did not impair the swallow in dysphagic patients.;Digestive system diseases;Interventional;Indication out-of-domain;Test
412;26099316;Transversus abdominis plane blockade in laparoscopic colorectal surgery: a double-blind randomized clinical trial.;"Introduction. Adequate postoperative analgesia is essential for recovery following colorectal surgery. Transversus abdominis plane (TAP) blocks have been found to be beneficial in improving pain following a variety of abdominal operations. The objective of this study was to determine if TAP blocks are useful in improving postoperative recovery following laparoscopic colorectal surgery. Materials and methods. A prospective double-blind randomized clinical trial, involving 226 consecutive patients having laparoscopic colorectal surgery, was performed by a university colorectal surgical department. Patients were randomized to either TAP blockade using ultrasound guidance, or control, with the primary outcome being postoperative pain, as measured by analgesic consumption. Secondary outcomes assessed were pain visual analogue score (VAS), respiratory function, time to return of gut function, length of hospital stay, postoperative complications, and patient satisfaction. Results. A total of 142 patients were followed up to trial completion (74 controls, 68 interventions). Patients were well matched with regard to demographics. No complications occurred as a result of the intervention of TAP blockade. There was no difference between groups with regards to analgesic consumption (161 mEq morphine control vs 175 mEq morphine TAP; p = 0.596). There was no difference between the two groups with regards to the secondary outcomes of daily VAS, respiratory outcome, time to return of gut function, length of hospital stay, postoperative complications, and patient satisfaction. Conclusion. We conclude that TAP blockade appears to be a safe intervention but confers no specific advantage following laparoscopic colorectal surgery.";Digestive system diseases;Interventional;Indication out-of-domain;Test
413;26159166;Fecal microbiota transplantation restores dysbiosis in patients with methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus enterocolitis.;Background. Nosocomial Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) enteritis is rare but can be fatal unless it is detected at an early stage and treated effectively. Dysbiosis of the gut is one of the leading reasons of MRSA enteritis. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a burgeoning treatment to rectify this imbalance. But the impact of FMT on MRSA enterocoitis is still unknown yet. Methods. A total of 5 patients diagnosed as MRSA enteritis during the early postoperative period were given vancomycin 2 g/day for 3 days and FMT for three continuous days as a standard treatment. Result. There was a 100% clinical response rate that all the symptoms resulting from MRSA enterocolitis disappeared and MRSA in the feces eliminated clearly. The microbiota profile in feces of the patients also regained balance. Conclusion. FMT can be a preferential measure to restore the dysbiosis caused by MSRA enterocolitis.;Digestive system diseases;Interventional;Indication out-of-domain;Test
414;27159420;Study of Gender Differences in Proton Pump Inhibitor Dose Requirements for GERD: A Double-Blind Randomized Trial.;"Goals. To determine the proportion of patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease who are on proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) who could reduce their prior dosage by half, and identify predictors of successful step-down. Background. Appropriate hypergastrinemia results from gastric acid inhibition. A gender difference in fasting gastrin with higher levels among women than among men on long-term PPI therapy has been demonstrated. Study. Patients with endoscopically verified erosive esophagitis on long-term PPI therapy were randomized double blindly to step down their dose by half or continue with the same dose for 8 weeks. Fasting gastrin levels were measured before and after treatment. The primary endpoint was successful step-down throughout the study period. Results. Overall, 100 patients were randomized, 49 (24 females) to continue with the same dose as before and 51 (25 females) to step down. Female patients had higher gastrin levels compared with male patients: 78 pg/mL (IQR, 50 to 99) versus 50 pg/mL (IQR, 36 to 74) (P=0.007). Among those randomized to the step-down intervention only 3/25 (12%) women failed to complete the 2 months of lower-dose therapy versus 9/25 (36%) men (P=0.09). Female gender (P=0.048) was the strongest predictor for successful step-down (odds ratio=1.27; 95% CI, 1.01-1.60). The chance of failing to maintain symptom control was twice as high in the reduction group (24%) as compared with the control group (13%) (P=0.2). Conclusions. Female patients on long-term PPI therapy were 3 times more likely to tolerate half of their prior dose. Female gender had higher probability for successful step-down. These results indicate that women with gastroesophageal reflux disease might manage with lower doses of PPIs as compared with men.European Clinical Trial Database (https://eudract.ema.europa.eu/), number 2013-002067-26.";Digestive system diseases;Interventional;Indication out-of-domain;Test
415;29030802;Treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease using radiofrequency ablation (Stretta procedure): An interim analysis of a randomized trial.;Background. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is the most common chronic gastrointestinal disorder, affecting one third of the population worldwide. Recently, there has been a renewed interest in Stretta therapy in view of potential long-term side effects of PPIs and the durability of relief with fundoplication. Method. Prospective randomized study comparing the Stretta treatment with controls receiving PPIs. Patient (> 18 years, n = 20) with symptoms of heartburn, regurgitation, abnormal esophageal acid exposure (≥ 4%), and endoscopically confirmed esophagitis were included into the study. The primary measure was improvement in quality of life (QOL) and decrease in the frequency and severity of GERD symptoms. Results. The mean age of the patients was 39 (± 15) years and controls were 34 (± 11) years. Three months after Stretta, 80% reported improvement in QOL compared to 40% in the control group. At the end of 3 months, significant (p < 0.05) improvement in GERD symptom score for heartburn, regurgitation, chest pain, and cough compared with the control group was observed. After Stretta treatment, 60% of the patients were free of PPIs whereas there was no change in the control group. Almost 80% of the patients on Stretta treatment were satisfied with the treatment compared to 30% of the patients in the control group. Conclusion. Stretta was effective in the short-term for the management of GERD.;Digestive system diseases;Interventional;Indication out-of-domain;Test
416;29935863;Rifaximin versus metronidazole in management of acute episode of hepatic encephalopathy: An open labeled randomized clinical trial.;"Background and study aims. Many regimens are tried in managing overt hepatic encephalopathy (HE). We investigated the efficacy of rifaximin versus metronidazole in management of an acute episode of HE on top of cirrhosis. Patients and methods. An open label prospective controlled trial was conducted on patients with an acute episode of HE on top of cirrhosis who were randomly divided into metronidazole-group (M-group) and rifaximin-group (R-group) with 60 patients in each. The main outcome measure was the clinical improvement of HE, duration of hospital stay and the changes in the level of serum ammonia after 3 days of starting therapy. Results. Both M-group and R-group were comparable as regards age and sex (mean age 51 ± 11 years and 49 ± 12; male/female ratio 45:15 and 50:10, respectively). Forty-six patients (76.7%) in M-group compared with forty-five (75%) in R-group showed clinical improvement (p = 0.412). Hospital stays were comparable between both group; 4.2 ± 2.1 and 3.9 ± 1.7 for M-group and R-group; respectively (p = 0.435). There was no significant difference of venous ammonia levels (Mean of delta 160.77 ± 185.34 µg/dL and 207.95 ± 218.43 µg/dL with p 0.664 and 0.974 in M-group and R-group, respectively). No adverse events were reported throughout the whole study. Conclusion. Rifaximin and metronidazole are equally effective in management of acute episode of overt HE, therefore, re-auditing of treatment protocols of HE are warranted especially in limited resource settings.";Digestive system diseases;Interventional;Indication out-of-domain;Test
417;30256365;Lacto-fermented sauerkraut improves symptoms in IBS patients independent of product pasteurisation - a pilot study.;"Lacto-fermented sauerkraut contains a natural variety of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and has not previously been studied in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients. The present study investigated the effect of a daily lacto-fermented sauerkraut supplement in relation to IBS patients' gastrointestinal symptoms and gut microbiota composition. A randomized double-blinded intervention was conducted with 34 Norwegian IBS patients. The patients were consuming either pasteurized sauerkraut (PS; n = 15) or unpasteurized sauerkraut (UPS; n = 19) as a supplement to their daily diet for 6 weeks. The differences in change of symptoms were assessed using the questionnaire IBS-Symptom Severity Score (IBS-SSS) measured at the baseline, and at weeks 2, 4, 6 and 8 (follow-up). The gut microbiota composition was analysed using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of faecal samples from the baseline and week 6. The mean change in IBS-SSS was -38.57 ± 17.08 PS vs. -56.99 ± 16.92 UPS and was significantly improved in both groups (P < 0.04), while the improvement in symptoms was not different between the intervention groups. The sauerkraut intervention (pasteurized or not) also led to significant gut microbiota compositional changes as determined by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing (un-weighted UniFrac: P = 0.001, weighted UniFrac: P = 0.001). Sauerkraut related LAB in feces (Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus brevis) were significantly more often present in the UPS-group. In conclusion lacto-fermented sauerkraut had an effect on IBS patients' symptoms and gut microbiota even though the study was underpowered. Our results indicate that the observed effect to a larger extent can be attributed to the potential prebiotics in lacto-fermented sauerkraut rather than the viable LAB. Future studies with greater statistical power are needed to clarify the possible effects of LAB from lacto-fermented sauerkraut in the treatment of IBS patients.";Digestive system diseases;Interventional;Indication out-of-domain;Test
418;30666969;Effects of synbiotic therapy in mild-to-moderately active ulcerative colitis: A randomized placebo-controlled study.;"Background/aims. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in the effects of probiotics and prebiotics on ulcerative colitis (UC). In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of synbiotic therapy on the clinical and endoscopic activities of the disease in patients with mild-to-moderately active UC. Materials and methods. Overall, 40 patients with mild-to-moderate UC activity were included in the study and were randomized to the synbiotic and control groups. Synbiotic therapy was administered in the synbiotic group and placebo was administered in the control group for 8 weeks. Both groups were evaluated and compared in terms of the acute phase reactants and clinical and endoscopic activities of the disease at the beginning and at the end of the 8-week therapy. Results. At the end of the study duration, the decrease in the serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and sedimentation values in the synbiotic group was statistically significant (p=0.003). In both groups, a statistically significant improvement was observed in the clinical and endoscopic activity levels at the end of the treatment (symbiotic: p=0.001 and p=0.002, respectively; control: p=0.005 and p=0.001, respectively). When the groups were compared with each other, improvement in the clinical activity was significantly higher in the synbiotic group (p<0.05). Conclusion. The use of synbiotic therapy in patients with UC has a significant effect on the improvement in clinical activity. Moreover, although it appears to positively affect the acute phase reactants and endoscopic activity levels, the difference was not significant when compared with the patients who did not receive synbiotic therapy.";Digestive system diseases;Interventional;Indication out-of-domain;Test
419;30952918;Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Study of a Multispecies Probiotic Mixture in Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.;The intestinal microbiota is closely associated with the development of obesity and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). This study investigated the effects of probiotic treatment on visceral fat area (VFA) and intrahepatic fat (IHF) fraction in NAFLD. Sixty-eight obese NAFLD patients (>5% proton density fat fraction [PDFF] on magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) were randomized to probiotic and placebo groups for 12 weeks. The probiotic mixture included 6 bacterial species. VFA and IHF were measured using the MRI-PDFF technique. Body weight and total body fat were reduced in the probiotic group but not in the placebo group. The mean IHF fraction was reduced after 12 weeks of treatment in the probiotic group compared to that at baseline (from 16.3 ± 15.0% to 14.1 ± 7.7%, p = 0.032) but was not reduced in the placebo group. The decrease in IHF (mean difference: -2.61%, p = 0.012) was also greater in the probiotic group than in the placebo group. Reduction of triglyceride was greater in the probiotic treatment group than in the placebo group (mean difference: -34.0 mg/dl, p = 0.0033). However, the changes in IHF percentage and triglyceride levels were not different between placebo and control groups after adjusting for changes in body weight.

420;27878567;Drug Interactions Between Peficitinib, an Orally Administered, Once-Daily Janus Kinase Inhibitor, and Rosuvastatin in Healthy Subjects.;Background and objective. Peficitinib is an orally administered, once-daily Janus kinase inhibitor in development for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Peficitinib and its major metabolite H2 inhibit the hepatic uptake transporter organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1) in vitro. This article reports a clinical study evaluating the effects of peficitinib on the pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin, a substrate for the OATP1B1 transporter, and vice versa. Methods. In an open-label, single-sequence clinical study, 24 healthy adults of East Asian and non-East Asian origin received a single dose of rosuvastatin 10 mg on days 1 and 10. On days 5-13, subjects received a daily dose of 150 mg peficitinib. Serial blood samples for pharmacokinetic assessment of rosuvastatin were collected up to 96 h post-dose on days 1 and 10, and for peficitinib were collected up to 24 h post-dose on days 9 and 10. Results. Co-administration of peficitinib with rosuvastatin increased rosuvastatin area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) and maximum plasma concentration (C max) by 18 and 15%, respectively and increased peficitinib AUC and C max by 16 and 28%, respectively. In East Asian (n = 6) vs. non-East Asian subjects (n = 18), peficitinib mean AUC for a dosing interval was 45 and 21% higher, and mean C max was 67 and 34% higher, when administered alone or with rosuvastatin. Peficitinib was well tolerated with few adverse events overall. Conclusion. In this study, once-daily oral administration of peficitinib had no clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin, a probe substrate for OATP1B1. Therefore, it is unlikely that peficitinib will have a clinically significant effect on the exposure of other substrates for OATP1B1. CLINICALTRIALS. Gov number.

421;28274253;Phase 1b randomized, double-blind study of namilumab, an anti-granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor monoclonal antibody, in mild-to-moderate rheumatoid arthritis.;"Background. Namilumab (AMG203) is an immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity to the GM-CSF ligand. This was a phase 1b, randomized, double-blind study (PRIORA) to assess namilumab in active, mild-to-moderate rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The primary outcome was the safety and tolerability of repeated subcutaneous injections of namilumab in patients with mild-to-moderate RA. Methods. Adults with mild-to-moderate RA on stable methotrexate doses for ≥12 weeks were eligible. Patients received three subcutaneous injections of namilumab 150 or 300 mg, or placebo on days 1, 15, and 29, with 12 weeks' follow-up. Primary objective was safety/tolerability. Results. Patients in cohort 1 were randomized to namilumab 150 mg (n = 8) or placebo (n = 5). In cohort 2, patients were randomized to namilumab 300 mg (n = 7) or placebo (n = 4). Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) was similar across the three groups (namilumab 150 mg: 63%; namilumab 300 mg: 57%; placebo: 56%). TEAEs in ≥10% of patients were nasopharyngitis (17%) and exacerbation/worsening of RA (13%). No anti-namilumab antibodies were detected. The pharmacokinetics of namilumab were linear and typical of a monoclonal antibody with subcutaneous administration. In a post hoc efficacy, per protocol analysis (n = 21), patients randomized to namilumab showed greater improvement in Disease Activity Score 28 (erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein [CRP]), swelling joint counts and tender joint counts compared with placebo. Difference in mean DAS28-CRP changes from baseline between namilumab and placebo favored namilumab at both doses and at all time points. In addition area under the curve for DAS28-CRP was analyzed as time-adjusted mean change from baseline. A significant improvement in DAS28-CRP was shown with namilumab (150 and 300 mg groups combined) compared with placebo at day 43 (p = 0.0117) and also 8 weeks after last dosing at day 99 (p = 0.0154). Conclusions. Subcutaneous namilumab was generally well tolerated. Although namilumab demonstrated preliminary evidence of efficacy, patient numbers were small; phase 2 studies are ongoing.

To evaluate if TNF inhibitor serum drug levels (DL) or anti-drug antibodies (ADAb) can predict successful dose reduction (in patients with high DL) or discontinuation (in patients with no/low DL or ADAb) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. Research design and methods. RA patients that were using adalimumab (n = 42), etanercept (n = 76) or infliximab (n = 51) and were doing well, were tapered until discontinuation or flare (1-1.5 year follow up). Random timed DL for adalimumab and etanercept and trough DL for infliximab were measured before dose reduction: Receiver-Operator-Curves (ROC) analyses with optimal cut-off DL were determined. Results. No predictive value of adalimumab and infliximab DL for all outcomes were found, except for an inverse association of lower etanercept DL and higher chance for successful dose reduction (Area Under the Curve (AUC) 0.36, 95% CI 0.23-0.49; cut-off <2.6 mg/l). In sub analyses, higher adalimumab trough DL predicted successful dose reduction (AUC 0.86, 0.58-1.00; cut-off >7.8). ADAb were infrequent and not predictive of successful discontinuation. Conclusions. No predictive value of baseline adalimumab, etanercept and infliximab DL or ADAb for successful dose reduction or discontinuation in RA was found in this context, with the possible exception of high adalimumab trough levels for successful dose reduction.";Immune system diseases;Interventional;Indication out-of-domain;Test

TNF inhibitors have improved treatment of Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, spondyloarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and chronic plaque psoriasis, but are expensive therapies. The aim of NOR-SWITCH was to examine switching from originator infliximab to the less expensive biosimilar CT-P13 regarding efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity. Methods. The study is a randomised, non-inferiority, double-blind, phase 4 trial with 52 weeks of follow-up. Adult patients on stable treatment with infliximab originator treated in a hospital setting for at least 6 months were eligible for participation. Patients with informed consent were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to either continued infliximab originator or to switch to CT-P13 treatment, with unchanged dosing regimen. Data were collected at infusion visits in 40 Norwegian study centres. Patients, assessors, and patient care providers were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was disease worsening during 52-week follow-up. 394 patients in the primary per-protocol set were needed to show a non-inferiority margin of 15%, assuming 30% disease worsening in each group. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02148640. Findings. Between Oct 24, 2014, and July 8, 2015, 482 patients were enrolled and randomised (241 to infliximab originator, 241 to CT-P13 group; one patient was excluded from the full analysis and safety set for CT-P13) and 408 were included in the per-protocol set (202 in the infliximab originator group and 206 in the CT-P13 group). 155 (32%) patients in the full analysis set had Crohn's disease, 93 (19%) had ulcerative colitis, 91 (19%) had spondyloarthritis, 77 (16%) had rheumatoid arthritis, 30 (6%) had psoriatic arthritis, and 35 (7%) had chronic plaque psoriasis. Disease worsening occurred in 53 (26%) patients in the infliximab originator group and 61 (30%) patients in the CT-P13 group (per-protocol set; adjusted treatment difference -4·4%, 95% CI -12·7 to 3·9). The frequency of adverse events was similar between groups (for serious adverse events, 24 [10%] for infliximab originator vs 21 [9%] for CT-P13; for overall adverse events, 168 [70%] vs 164 [68%]; and for adverse events leading to discontinuation, nine [4%] vs eight [3%], respectively). Interpretation. The NOR-SWITCH trial showed that switching from infliximab originator to CT-P13 was not inferior to continued treatment with infliximab originator according to a prespecified non-inferiority margin of 15%. The study was not powered to show non-inferiority in individual diseases. Funding. Norwegian Ministry of Health and Care Services.";Immune system diseases;Interventional;Indication out-of-domain;Test
424;28584187;Efficacy and safety of the biosimilar ABP 501 compared with adalimumab in patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis: a randomised, double-blind, phase III equivalence study.;"Objectives. ABP 501 is a Food and Drug Administration-approved biosimilar to adalimumab; structural, functional and pharmacokinetic evaluations have shown that the two are highly similar. We report results from a phase III study comparing efficacy, safety and immunogenicity between ABP 501 and adalimumab. Methods. In this randomised, double-blind, active comparator-controlled, 26-week equivalence study, patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) despite methotrexate were randomised (1:1) to ABP 501 or adalimumab (40 mg) every 2 weeks. Primary endpoint was risk ratio (RR) of ACR20 between groups at week 24. Primary hypothesis that the treatments were equivalent would be confirmed if the 90% CI for RR of ACR20 at week 24 fell between 0.738 and 1.355, demonstrating that ABP 501 is similar to adalimumab. Secondary endpoints included Disease Activity Score 28-joint count-C reactive protein (DAS28-CRP). Safety was assessed via adverse events (AEs) and laboratory evaluations. Antidrug antibodies were assessed to determine immunogenicity. Results. A total of 526 patients were randomised (n=264, ABP 501; n=262 adalimumab) and 494 completed the study. ACR20 response at week 24 was 74.6% (ABP 501) and 72.4% (adalimumab). At week 24, the RR of ACR20 (90% CI) between groups was 1.039 (0.954, 1.133), confirming the primary hypothesis. Changes from baseline in DAS28-CRP, ACR50 and ACR70 were similar. There were no clinically meaningful differences in AEs and laboratory abnormalities. A total of 38.3% (ABP 501) and 38.2% (adalimumab) of patients tested positive for binding antidrug antibodies. Conclusions.

425;28855173;Sirukumab for rheumatoid arthritis: the phase III SIRROUND-D study.;"Objectives. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is implicated in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) pathophysiology. Unlike IL-6 receptor inhibitors, sirukumab is a human monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to the IL-6 cytokine. The phase III, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group SIRROUND-D study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01604343) evaluated the efficacy and safety of sirukumab in patients with active RA refractory to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. Methods. Patients were randomised 1:1:1 to treatment with sirukumab 100 mg every 2 weeks, 50 mg every 4 weeks or placebo every 2 weeks subcutaneously. Results through week 52 are reported. Results. Of 1670 randomised patients, significantly more patients achieved American College of Rheumatology 20% (ACR20) response at week 16 (coprimary endpoint) with sirukumab 100 mg every 2 weeks (53.5%) or 50 mg every 4 weeks (54.8%) versus placebo (26.4%; both p<0.001). Mean (SD) change from baseline in modified Sharp/van der Heijde score at week 52 (coprimary endpoint) was significantly lower with sirukumab (100 mg every 2 weeks: 0.46 (3.26); 50 mg every 4 weeks: 0.50 (2.96)) versus placebo (3.69 (9.25); both p<0.001). All major secondary endpoints (week 24 Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index change from baseline, ACR50 response, 28-joint Disease Activity Score based on C reactive protein and major clinical response (ACR70 for six continuous months by week 52)) were met. The most common adverse events with sirukumab were elevated liver enzymes, upper respiratory tract infection, injection site erythema and nasopharyngitis. Conclusions. Sirukumab 100 mg every 2 weeks and 50 mg every 4 weeks led to significant reductions in RA symptoms, inhibition of structural damage progression and physical function and quality of life improvements, with an expected safety profile.

ADDRESS II is a 24-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm, phase IIb study evaluating the safety and efficacy of atacicept in patients with SLE (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01972568). Patients with active, autoantibody-positive SLE receiving standard therapy were randomized (1:1:1) to receive atacicept (75 mg or 150 mg) or placebo for 24 weeks. The primary end point was the SLE responder index 4 (SRI-4) at week 24. Results. The intent-to-treat (ITT) population included 306 patients. There was a trend toward an improved SRI-4 response rate with atacicept 75 mg (57.8%; adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.78, P = 0.045) and 150 mg (53.8%; adjusted OR 1.56, P = 0.121) at week 24 as compared with placebo (44.0%) (primary analysis; using the screening visit as baseline). In a prespecified sensitivity analysis using study day 1 as baseline, a significantly larger proportion of patients receiving atacicept 75 mg and 150 mg achieved an SRI-4 response at week 24 compared with placebo. In predefined subpopulations with high levels of disease activity (HDA) at baseline, serologically active disease, or both, statistically significant improvements in the SRI-4 and SRI-6 response rates were seen with atacicept versus placebo. A severe risk of disease flare was reduced with atacicept therapy in both the ITT and the HDA populations. The risks of serious adverse events and serious or severe infection were not increased with atacicept as compared with placebo. Conclusion. Atacicept treatment showed evidence of efficacy in SLE, particularly in HDA and serologically active patients. Reductions in disease activity and severe flare were observed with atacicept treatment, with an acceptable safety profile.";Immune system diseases;Interventional;Indication out-of-domain;Test

This subgroup analysis based on a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 52-week phase 3 study (SIRROUND-D) assessed American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 response at week 16 and van der Heijde-modified Sharp score (vdH-S) at week 52 (coprimary endpoints). Results. A total of 168 (Japanese)/1670 patients received sirukumab 50 mg/4 weeks (q4w, n = 58), 100 mg/every 2 weeks (q2w, n = 54), or placebo (n = 56) subcutaneously. Significantly more patients achieved ACR20 response at week 16 with sirukumab (50 mg q4w: 69.0%; 100mg q2w: 66.7%) vs. placebo (21.4%; p < .001). Median change from baseline in total vdH-S score at week 52 was significantly lower with sirukumab (50 mg q4w: 0.3, p = .024; 100 mg q2w: 0.0, p = .002) vs. placebo (1.3). Sirukumab consistently showed greater improvements in secondary endpoints at weeks 24 and 52. Nasopharyngitis, elevated liver enzymes, injection site erythema and upper respiratory tract infections were the common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Incidences of TEAEs and serious AEs were consistent between sirukumab groups through week 52. Conclusion.

428;29484638;Safety, Pharmacokinetics, and Pharmacodynamics in Healthy Volunteers Treated With GDC-0853, a Selective Reversible Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor.;"GDC-0853 is a small molecule inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) that is highly selective and noncovalent, leading to reversible binding. In double-blind, randomized, and placebo-controlled phase I healthy volunteer studies, GDC-0853 was well tolerated, with no dose-limiting adverse events (AEs) or serious AEs. The maximum tolerated dose was not reached during dose escalation (≤600 mg, single ascending dose (SAD) study; ≤250 mg twice daily (b.i.d.) and ≤500 mg once daily, 14-day multiple ascending dose (MAD) study). Plasma concentrations peaked 1-3 hours after oral administration and declined thereafter, with a steady-state half-life ranging from 4.2-9.9 hours. Independent assays demonstrated dose-dependent BTK target engagement. Based on pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) simulations, a once-daily dosing regimen (e.g., 100 mg, q.d.) is expected to maintain a high level of BTK inhibition over the dosing interval. Taken together, the safety and PK/PD data support GDC-0853 evaluation in rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and other autoimmune or inflammatory indications.";Immune system diseases;Interventional;Indication out-of-domain;Test
429;30043749;Baricitinib for systemic lupus erythematosus: a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial.;"Background. Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus have substantial unmet medical need. Baricitinib is an oral selective Janus kinase (JAK)1 and JAK2 inhibitor that we hypothesised might have therapeutic benefit in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. Methods. In this double-blind, multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled, 24-week phase 2 study, patients were recruited from 78 centres in 11 countries. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, had a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus, and had active disease involving skin or joints. We randomly assigned patients (1:1:1) to receive once-daily baricitinib 2 mg, baricitinib 4 mg, or placebo for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving resolution of arthritis or rash at week 24, as defined by Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index-2000 (SLEDAI-2K). Efficacy and safety analyses included all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02708095. Findings. Between March 24, 2016, and April 27, 2017, 314 patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo (n=105), baricitinib 2 mg (n=105), or baricitinib 4 mg (n=104). At week 24, resolution of SLEDAI-2K arthritis or rash was achieved by 70 (67%) of 104 patients receiving baricitinib 4 mg (odds ratio [OR] vs placebo 1·8, 95% CI 1·0-3·3; p=0·0414) and 61 (58%) of 105 patients receiving baricitinib 2 mg (OR 1·3, 0·7-2·3; p=0·39). Adverse events were reported in 68 (65%) patients in the placebo group, 75 (71%) patients in the baricitinib 2 mg group, and 76 (73%) patients in the baricitinib 4 mg group. Serious adverse events were reported in ten (10%) patients receiving baricitinib 4 mg, 11 (10%) receiving baricitinib 2 mg, and five (5%) receiving placebo; no deaths were reported. Serious infections were reported in six (6%) patients with baricitinib 4 mg, two (2%) with baricitinib 2 mg, and one (1%) with placebo. Interpretation. The baricitinib 4 mg dose, but not the 2 mg dose, significantly improved the signs and symptoms of active systemic lupus erythematosus in patients who were not adequately controlled despite standard of care therapy, with a safety profile consistent with previous studies of baricitinib. This study provides the foundation for future phase 3 trials of JAK1/2 inhibition with baricitinib as a new potential oral therapy for systemic lupus erythematosus. Funding.

The safety and efficacy of weight-based ribavirin (RBV) dosing regimens in patients with HIV-HCV coinfection has not been demonstrated in randomized clinical trials. Objective. This randomized, double-blind, international, parallel-group study in specialist outpatient clinics in the United States, Spain, and Portugal compares the efficacy and safety of 2 RBV dose regimens (800 mg/day and 1000/1200 mg/day) combined with peginterferon alfa-2a (40KD) in patients with HIV-HCV (genotype 1) coinfection. Methods. Patients with HIV-HCV coinfection, quantifiable HCV RNA in serum, HCV genotype-1 infection, compensated liver disease, and stable HIV disease (CD4+ count ≥100 cells/µL) with or without ongoing antiretroviral therapy were randomized to 48 weeks' treatment with RBV at standard dose (800 mg/day) or weight-based dose (1000 mg/day for patients weighing <75 kg; 1200 mg/day for patients weighing ≥75 kg) in combination with peginterferon alfa-2a (40KD) 180 µg once a week. Planned enrollment was 400 patients with ≥100 non-Latino African Americans. The primary endpoint was sustained virological response (SVR) (undetectable HCV RNA [<20 IU/mL] at the end of a 24-week untreated follow-up period [week 72]). Results. SVR rates were 19% (26/135) and 22% (60/275) in patients randomized to RBV 800 mg/day and 1000/1200 mg/day, respectively (odds ratio, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.68-1.93; P = .6119). In the 1000/1200 mg/day RBV dose group, the incidence of hemoglobin reductions <100 g/L and anaemia reported as an adverse event were higher versus the standard 800 mg/day RBV dose group. Conclusions. Compared with the standard RBV dose (800 mg/day), weight-based RBV dosing (1000/1200 mg/day) did not significantly increase SVR rates, but did increase the incidence of anemia in HIV-HCV (genotype 1) coinfected patients.";Infectious or parasitic diseases;Interventional;Indication out-of-domain;Test

Its safety and efficacy in patients with HCV and HIV-1 are unknown. Objective To assess the safety and efficacy of TVR plus PEG-IFN-α2a-ribavirin in patients with genotype 1 HCV and HIV-1 and to evaluate pharmacokinetics of TVR and antiretrovirals during coadministration. Design Phase 2a, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00983853). Setting 16 international multicenter sites. Patients 62 patients with HCV genotype 1 and HIV-1 who were HCV treatment-naive and receiving 0 or 1 of 2 antiretroviral regimens were randomly assigned to TVR plus PEG-IFN-α2a-ribavirin or placebo plus PEG-IFN-α2a-ribavirin for 12 weeks, plus 36 weeks of PEG-IFN-α2a-ribavirin. Measurements HCV RNA concentrations. Results Pruritus, headache, nausea, rash, and dizziness were higher with TVR plus PEG-IFN-α2a-ribavirin during the first 12 weeks. During this period, serious adverse events occurred in 5% (2 in 38) of those receiving TVR plus PEG-IFN-α2a-ribavirin and 0% (0 in 22) of those receiving placebo plus PEG-IFN-α2a-ribavirin; the same number in both groups discontinued treatment due to adverse events. Sustained virologic response occurred in 74% (28 in 38) of patients receiving TVR plus PEG-IFN-α2a-ribavirin and 45% (10 in 22) of patients receiving placebo plus PEG-IFN-α2a-ribavirin. Rapid HCV suppression was seen with TVR plus PEG-IFN-α2a-ribavirin (68% [26 in 38 patients] vs. 0% [0 in 22 patients] undetectable HCV RNA levels by week 4). Two patients had on-treatment HCV breakthrough with TVR-resistant variants. Patients treated with antiretroviral drugs had no HIV breakthroughs; antiretroviral exposure was not substantially modified by TVR. Limitation Small sample size and appreciable dropout rate. Conclusion In patients with HCV and HIV-1, more adverse events occurred with TVR versus placebo plus PEG-IFN-α2a-ribavirin; these were similar in nature and severity to those in patients with HCV treated with TVR.

This study examined 8 weeks of treatment with this regimen. Methods In this phase 3, open-label study, we randomly assigned 647 previously untreated patients with HCV genotype 1 infection without cirrhosis to receive ledipasvir and sofosbuvir (ledipasvir-sofosbuvir) for 8 weeks, ledipasvir-sofosbuvir plus ribavirin for 8 weeks, or ledipasvir-sofosbuvir for 12 weeks. The primary end point was sustained virologic response at 12 weeks after the end of therapy. Results The rate of sustained virologic response was 94% (95% confidence interval [CI], 90 to 97) with 8 weeks of ledipasvir-sofosbuvir, 93% (95% CI, 89 to 96) with 8 weeks of ledipasvir-sofosbuvir plus ribavirin, and 95% (95% CI, 92 to 98) with 12 weeks of ledipasvir-sofosbuvir. As compared with the rate of sustained virologic response in the group that received 8 weeks of ledipasvir-sofosbuvir, the rate in the 12-week group was 1 percentage point higher (97.5% CI, -4 to 6) and the rate in the group that received 8 weeks of ledipasvir-sofosbuvir with ribavirin was 1 percentage point lower (95% CI, -6 to 4); these results indicated noninferiority of the 8-week ledipasvir-sofosbuvir regimen, on the basis of a noninferiority margin of 12 percentage points. Adverse events were more common in the group that received ribavirin than in the other two groups. No patient who received 8 weeks of only ledipasvir-sofosbuvir discontinued treatment owing to adverse events. Conclusions Ledipasvir-sofosbuvir for 8 weeks was associated with a high rate of sustained virologic response among previously untreated patients with HCV genotype 1 infection without cirrhosis. No additional benefit was associated with the inclusion of ribavirin in the regimen or with extension of the duration of treatment to 12 weeks.

434;25304641;Sofosbuvir and ribavirin for treatment of compensated recurrent hepatitis C virus infection after liver transplantation.;"Background & aims. Interferon alfa-based regimens used to treat recurrent hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection after liver transplantation are poorly tolerated, associated with generally modest efficacy, and can interact with immunosuppressive agents. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of an interferon-free regimen of the nucleotide polymerase inhibitor sofosbuvir combined with ribavirin for 24 weeks in treating post-transplantation HCV infection. Methods. In a prospective, multicenter, open-label pilot study, we enrolled patients with compensated recurrent HCV infection of any genotype after a primary or secondary liver transplantation. All patients received 24 weeks of sofosbuvir 400 mg daily and ribavirin starting at 400 mg daily, which was adjusted according to creatinine clearance and hemoglobin values. The primary end point was sustained virologic response 12 weeks after treatment. Results. Of the 40 patients enrolled and treated, 78% were male, 85% were white, 83% had HCV genotype 1, 40% had cirrhosis (based on biopsy), and 88% had been previously treated with interferon. Sustained virologic response 12 weeks after treatment was achieved by 28 of 40 patients (70%; 90% confidence interval: 56%-82%). Relapse accounted for all cases of virologic failure. No patients had detectable viral resistance during or after treatment. The most common adverse events were fatigue (30%), diarrhea (28%), and headache (25%). In addition, 20% of the subjects experienced anemia. Two patients discontinued study treatment because of adverse events, which were considered unrelated to study treatment. No deaths, graft losses, or episodes of rejection occurred. No interactions with any concomitant immunosuppressive agents were reported. Conclusions. Sofosbuvir and ribavirin combination therapy for 24 weeks is an effective and well-tolerated interferon-free treatment for post-transplantation HCV infection.

We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of an all-oral, fixed-dose combination of the hepatitis C virus NS5A inhibitor ledipasvir and the NS5B nucleotide polymerase inhibitor sofosbuvir with and without ribavirin for 12 weeks in treatment-naive and previously treated Japanese patients with chronic genotype 1 hepatitis C virus infection. Methods In this randomised, open-label study, we enrolled patients from 19 clinical Japanese centres. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either ledipasvir (90 mg) and sofosbuvir (400 mg) or ledipasvir, sofosbuvir, and ribavirin (dosed according to the Japanese Copegus product label-ie, patients ≤60 kg received 600 mg daily, patients >60 kg to ≤80 kg received 800 mg daily, and patients >80 kg received 1000 mg daily) orally once daily for 12 weeks. After completion or early discontinuation of treatment, patients were followed up off-treatment for 24 weeks. Eligible patients were at least 20 years of age with chronic genotype 1 hepatitis C virus infection with serum hepatitis C virus RNA concentrations of at least 5 log10 IU/mL, creatinine clearance of at least 1·0 mL/s, and a platelet count of at least 50 × 10(9) per L. An interactive web response system was used to manage patient randomisation and treatment assignment. Randomisation was stratified by the presence or absence of cirrhosis for treatment-naive patients and stratified by presence or absence of cirrhosis and by previous treatment category (relapser or breakthrough, non-responder, or interferon-intolerant) for previously treated patients. Within each strata, patients were sequentially assigned to either treatment with ledipasvir-sofosbuvir or ledipasvir-sofosbuvir plus ribavirin in a 1:1 ratio with block size of 4. The primary endpoint was sustained virological response 12 weeks after completion of treatment (SVR12) assessed in all patients who were randomly assigned and received at least one dose of study drug; safety outcomes were assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01975675. Findings Between Oct 15, 2013 and Dec 13, 2013, 341 patients were randomly assigned to treatment groups and received at least one dose of study treatment. SVR12 was achieved in all 171 (100%) patients (83 of 83 treatment naive and 88 of 88 treatment experienced) receiving ledipasvir-sofosbuvir (95% CI 98-100) and 167 (98%) of 170 patients (80 of 83 treatment naive and 87 of 87 treatment experienced) receiving ledipasvir-sofosbuvir plus ribavirin (95% CI 95-100). Of the 76 patients with baseline NS5A resistant variants, 75 (99%) achieved SVR12. Two (1·2%) of 170 patients in the ledipasvir-sofosbuvir plus ribavirin group discontinued treatment because of adverse events. The most common adverse events were nasopharyngitis (50 [29·2%] of 171), headache (12 [7·0%] of 171), and malaise (nine [5·3%] of 171) in patients receiving ledipasvir-sofosbuvir; and nasopharyngitis (40 [23·5%] of 170), anaemia (23 [13·5%] of 170), and headache in those receiving ledipasvir-sofosbuvir and ribavirin (15 [8·8%] of 170). Interpretation Although existing regimens for the treatment of hepatitis C virus are effective for many patients, medical needs remain unmet, particularly in Japan where the population with hepatitis C virus genotype 1 is generally older and treatment-experienced, with advanced liver disease. The efficacy, tolerability, and absence of drug-drug interactions of ledipasvir-sofosbuvir suggest that it could be an important option for treatment of genotype 1 hepatitis C virus in Japanese patients.

There are no effective and safe treatments for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection of patients who have advanced liver disease. Methods. In this phase 2, open-label study, we assessed treatment with the NS5A inhibitor ledipasvir, the nucleotide polymerase inhibitor sofosbuvir, and ribavirin in patients infected with HCV genotypes 1 or 4. Cohort A enrolled patients with cirrhosis and moderate or severe hepatic impairment who had not undergone liver transplantation. Cohort B enrolled patients who had undergone liver transplantation: those without cirrhosis; those with cirrhosis and mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment; and those with fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis. Patients were assigned randomly (1:1) to receive 12 or 24 weeks of a fixed-dose combination tablet containing ledipasvir and sofosbuvir, once daily, plus ribavirin. The primary end point was sustained virologic response at 12 weeks after the end of treatment (SVR12). Results. We enrolled 337 patients, 332 (99%) with HCV genotype 1 infection and 5 (1%) with HCV genotype 4 infection. In cohort A (nontransplant), SVR12 was achieved by 86%-89% of patients. In cohort B (transplant recipients), SVR12 was achieved by 96%-98% of patients without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis, by 85%-88% of patients with moderate hepatic impairment, by 60%-75% of patients with severe hepatic impairment, and by all 6 patients with fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis. Response rates in the 12- and 24-week groups were similar. Thirteen patients (4%) discontinued the ledipasvir and sofosbuvir combination prematurely because of adverse events; 10 patients died, mainly from complications related to hepatic decompensation. Conclusion. The combination of ledipasvir, sofosbuvir, and ribavirin for 12 weeks produced high rates of SVR12 in patients with advanced liver disease, including those with decompensated cirrhosis before and after liver transplantation.

In cohort A, among patients with genotype 1 HCV, SVR12 was achieved by 20 (87%, 90% CI 70-96) of 23 CTP-B patients with 12 weeks of treatment; 22 (96%, 81-100) of 23 CTP-B patients with 24 weeks of treatment; 17 (85%, 66-96) of 20 CTP-C patients (12 weeks treatment); and 18 (78%, 60-91) of 23 CTP-C patients (24 weeks treatment). In cohort B, among patients with genotype 1 HCV, SVR12 was achieved by 42 (93%, 84-98) of 45 patients without cirrhosis (12 weeks treatment); 44 (100%, 93-100) of 44 patients without cirrhosis (24 weeks treatment); 30 (100%, 91-100) of 30 CTP-A patients (12 weeks treatment); 27 (96%, 84-100) of 28 CTP-A patients (24 weeks treatment); 19 (95%, 78-100) of 20 CTP-B patients (12 weeks treatment); 20 (100%, 86-100) of 20 CTP-B patients (24 weeks treatment); one (50%, 3-98) of two CTP-C patients (12 weeks treatment); and four (80%, 34-99) of five CTP-C patients (24 weeks treatment). All five patients with fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis achieved SVR12 (100%, 90% CI 55-100). Among all patients with genotype 4 HCV, SVR12 was achieved by 14 (78%, 56-92) of 18 patients (12 weeks treatment) and 16 (94%, 75-100) of 17 patients (24 weeks treatment). Seven patients (2%) discontinued ledipasvir-sofosbuvir prematurely due to adverse events. 17 patients died, mainly from complications of hepatic decompensation. Interpretation Ledipasvir-sofosbuvir and ribavirin provided high rates of SVR12 for patients with advanced liver disease, including those with decompensated cirrhosis before or after liver transplantation.

439;27842383;Treatment With Ledipasvir-Sofosbuvir for 12 or 24 Weeks in Kidney Transplant Recipients With Chronic Hepatitis C Virus Genotype 1 or 4 Infection: A Randomized Trial.;Background Use of interferon and ribavirin to treat chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in kidney transplant recipients is limited because of the risk for allograft rejection and poor tolerability. Objective To evaluate the safety and efficacy of the interferon- and ribavirin-free regimen ledipasvir-sofosbuvir in kidney transplant recipients with chronic genotype 1 or 4 HCV infection. Design Randomized, phase 2, open-label study. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02251717). Setting 5 sites in Europe. Patients Treatment-naive or -experienced kidney transplant recipients with chronic genotype 1 or 4 HCV infection, with or without compensated cirrhosis, and with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 40 mL/min or greater were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive ledipasvir (90 mg) and sofosbuvir (400 mg) for 12 or 24 weeks. Measurements The primary end point was sustained virologic response at 12 weeks after therapy ended (SVR12). Results Among 114 patients, the median age was 53 years, 58% were male, 91% had genotype 1 infection, 69% were treatment naive, and 15% had compensated cirrhosis. The median eGFR was 56 mL/min (range, 35 to 135 mL/min). One hundred percent of patients (57 of 57) treated for 12 weeks (95% CI, 94% to 100%) and 100% of those (57 of 57) treated for 24 weeks (CI, 94% to 100%) achieved SVR12. Serious adverse events were reported in 13 patients (11%). Of these, 3 events-syncope, pulmonary embolism, and serum creatinine increase-in 3 patients were determined to be treatment related. One patient permanently discontinued treatment because of an adverse event (syncope). The most frequent adverse events overall were headache (n = 22 [19%]), asthenia (n = 16 [14%]), and fatigue (n = 11 [10%]). Limitations The study was open label, no inferential statistics were planned, and only patients with genotype 1 or 4 infection were included. Few patients with HCV genotype 1a and cirrhosis were enrolled. Conclusion Treatment with ledipasvir-sofosbuvir for 12 or 24 weeks was well-tolerated and seemed to have an acceptable safety profile among kidney transplant recipients with HCV genotype 1 or 4 infection, all of whom achieved SVR12.

440;27265548;Effects of first-generation antipsychotics versus second-generation antipsychotics on quality of life in schizophrenia: a double-blind, randomised study.;"Background. Whether or not second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) represent an advantage over first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs) in the treatment of schizophrenia is not certain. Effectiveness studies published in the past 10 years have not unequivocally confirmed the superiority of SGAs over FGAs. We aimed to compare quality of life in patients with schizophrenia on an FGA strategy with those on an SGA strategy. Methods. In the multicentre, randomised, double-blind Neuroleptic Strategy Study (NeSSy), we recruited participants (aged 18-65 years) with schizophrenia (ICD-10: F20.X) who required treatment initiation or a change in treatment, from 14 psychiatric university hospitals and state hospitals in Germany. Double randomisation allowed for restricted selection of a treatment within each antipsychotic drug group (FGA or SGA) for an individual patient: first, patients were assigned with a random number table to two of six possible drug pairs, each pair consisting of an FGA (haloperidol [3-6 mg] or flupentixol [6-12 mg]) given orally and an SGA (aripiprazole [10-20 mg], olanzapine [10-20 mg], or quetiapine [400-800 mg]) given orally, and the investigator then selected which pair was best suited to the patient; a second, double-blind random assignment allocated either the FGA or the SGA from the investigator-chosen pair to the patient. Treatment duration was 24 weeks. Primary outcomes were change from baseline to week 24 in quality of life (SF-36) and clinical global impression (CGI-I), analysed in all randomly assigned patients who received at least one dose of the study drug. Safety was assessed in a safety set, consisting of all randomly assigned patients who received at least one dose of the study drug, coinciding with the set of the efficacy analyses. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01164059; German Clinical Trials Register, number DRKS00000304; WHO ICTRP, number U1111-1112-9727; and EudraCT, number 2009-010966-47. Findings. Between April 1, 2010, and May 31, 2013, 149 patients were randomly assigned, 69 to FGA treatment and 80 to SGA treatment. 136 patients received at least one dose of study drug (63 in the FGA group, 73 in the SGA group). Mean area under the curve (AUC) values of SF-36 were significantly higher in the SGA group than in the FGA group (85·1 [SD 14·7] vs 79·7 [17·3], p=0·0112). Mean AUC values for CGI-I scores decreased in both groups, but were not significantly different between the two groups (3·39 [SD 0·89] in the FGA group vs 3·26 [0·92] in the SGA group, p=0·3423). 30 (48%) of 63 patients given FGAs had at least one adverse event compared with 42 (57%) of 73 patients given an SGA (p=0·3019); the most common were nervous system disorders (18 [60%] of 30 in the FGA group vs 19 [45%] of 42 in the SGA group) and psychiatric disorders (ten [33%] vs 16 [38%]). One patient died after cessation of study drug (olanzapine), most likely as a result of an illicit drug overdose. The increase in body-mass index (BMI) was significantly higher in the SGA group than in the FGA group (p=0·0021 at week 6 and p=0·0041 at week 24). Interpretation. Improvement of patient-reported quality of life was significantly higher in patients with schizophrenia given SGAs than in those given FGAs, when treatment selection was individualised. This advantage, however, has to be weighed against the potential metabolic adverse effects of some SGAs. Funding.

441;27427558;Long-term cariprazine treatment for the prevention of relapse in patients with schizophrenia: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.;"Cariprazine, a dopamine D3/D2 receptor partial agonist with preference for D3 receptors, has demonstrated efficacy in randomized controlled trials in schizophrenia. This multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study evaluated the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of cariprazine for relapse prevention in adults with schizophrenia; total study duration was up to 97weeks. Schizophrenia symptoms were treated/stabilized with cariprazine 3-9mg/d during 20-week open-label treatment consisting of an 8-week, flexible-dose run-in phase and a 12-week fixed-dose stabilization phase. Stable patients who completed open-label treatment could be randomized to continued cariprazine (3, 6, or 9mg/d) or placebo for double-blind treatment (up to 72weeks). The primary efficacy parameter was time to relapse (worsening of symptom scores, psychiatric hospitalization, aggressive/violent behavior, or suicidal risk); clinical measures were implemented to ensure safety in case of impending relapse. A total of 264/765 patients completed open-label treatment; 200 eligible patients were randomized to double-blind placebo (n=99) or cariprazine (n=101). Time to relapse was significantly longer in cariprazine- versus placebo-treated patients (P=.0010, log-rank test). Relapse occurred in 24.8% of cariprazine- and 47.5% of placebo-treated patients (hazard ratio [95% CI]=0.45 [0.28, 0.73]). Akathisia (19.2%), insomnia (14.4%), and headache (12.0%) were reported in ≥10% of patients during open-label treatment; there were no cariprazine adverse events ≥10% during double-blind treatment. Long-term cariprazine treatment was significantly more effective than placebo for relapse prevention in patients with schizophrenia. The long-term safety profile in this study was consistent with the safety profile observed in previous cariprazine clinical trials.

442;28714728;Functional neural changes following behavioral therapies and disulfiram for cocaine dependence.;"A growing literature exists on neural correlates of treatment outcome. However, different types-or components of-treatment have distinct theorized mechanisms of action. And it is not yet known how changes in neural activity across treatment relate to engagement in different treatment components. Participants with cocaine use disorders in a randomized clinical trial received cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) plus, in a 2 × 2 design, contingency management (CM) or no CM, and disulfiram or placebo. Participants performed a functional MRI Stroop task, a measure of cognitive control, at the beginning of and after the 12-week treatment. Analyses assessed changes in Stroop-related neural activity within the sample overall and assessed how changes in Stroop-related activity correlated with measures of treatment process specific to each form of treatment (i.e., participation in CBT sessions, receipt of CM prizes, administration of disulfiram pills). Within the sample overall, compared with beginning of treatment, posttreatment Stroop-related neural activity was diminished in the hippocampus, thalamus, cingulate, precentral, post- and precentral gyrus, and precuneus and culmen regions (pFWE < .05). In separate whole-brain correlation analyses, greater reductions in Stroop-related activity were associated with more treatment engagement-""CBT sessions"" with the precentral gyrus, inferior parietal lobule, and middle and medial frontal gyrus; ""CM prizes"" with the postcentral frontal gyrus. Disulfiram ""medication days"" were not associated with changes in Stroop-related activity. Findings suggest that key process indicators of CBT and CM may be associated with functional changes in cognitive-control-related neurocircuitry.

443;29248909;Stimulation of Executive Functions as Part of the Language Intervention Process in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder.;Aims. Identifying effective methods for stimulating language and communication of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is fundamental to the effective use of available resources to support these children. This pilot study was designed to explore the potential benefits of a program of stimulation of executive functions (SEF) on the functional aspects of language and communication through the assessment of the functional communicative profile and social-cognitive performance. Methods. Twenty children, aged 5-12 years, with a diagnosis of ASD participated in the study. Two stimulation programs were offered over a 10- to 12-week period as part of the regular services offered to these children through a University's speech and language therapy outpatient clinic in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Children either received SEF intervention in their home implemented by their parent/s, with close monitoring by the speech-language pathologist (SLP) (group 1), or they received SEF by the SLP during regular speech-language therapy individual sessions (group 2). Results. The findings suggested that there were differences between the children's pre- and posttest performance. Significantly different performances were observed in the areas of occupation of communication space, proportion of communicative interactivity, and social-cognitive performance. Conclusion. The inclusion of activities to stimulate executive function abilities in language intervention for children with ASD warrants further investigation.;Mental, behavioural or neurodevelopmental disorders;Interventional;Indication out-of-domain;Test
444;29543538;The Effect of Saffron on Depression among Recovered Consumers of Methamphetamine Living with HIV/AIDS.;Background. From one hand, depression is one of the symptoms that occur after abstinence from methamphetamine. On the other people living with HIV/AIDS are in isolation due to the nature of their illness and depression is one of the most common mental health problems they experience. Objectives. This study was aimed at determining the effectiveness of saffron on reducing depression among recovered consumers of methamphetamine living with HIV/AIDS. Methods. The design of this study was semi-experimental with pre-test, post-test and control (placebo) groups. The statistical population consisted of all recovered consumers of methamphetamine living with HIV/AIDS who were referred to the Positive Club. Fifty-seven (57) recovered consumers of methamphetamine, living with HIV/AIDS, were selected by convenience sampling method. They were randomly assigned to an experimental (saffron) group and a control (placebo) group. The experimental group received 30 ml of saffron per day for 8 weeks, whereas the control (placebo) group received placebo the same way. BDI-II was used in this study as a measurement instrument. ANCOVA models were used for statistical inference. Results. The findings showed that saffron and its ingredients had been effective in reducing depression among this group (P < 0.05). Conclusion. In fact, saffron with its active ingredients (Crusin and Saffranal) by serotonin and dopamine secretion in the brain, help in reducing depression among recovered consumers of methamphetamine living with HIV/AIDS.;Mental, behavioural or neurodevelopmental disorders;Interventional;Indication out-of-domain;Test
445;29680437;Treatment of restless legs syndrome/Willis-Ekbom disease with the non-selective ENT1/ENT2 inhibitor dipyridamole: testing the adenosine hypothesis.;Objectives. Recent animal models of restless legs syndrome (RLS) suggest that brain iron deficiency is associated with a hypoadenosinergic state, with downregulation of adenosine A1 receptors (A1R) in the striatum and cortex. We hypothesized that an increase in extracellular adenosine induced by inhibitors of adenosine transporters, such as the non-selective ENT1/ENT2 inhibitor dipyridamole, would result in an improvement in RLS symptoms. Methods. In a prospective two-month open-label, non-placebo controlled clinical trial, 15 untreated idiopathic RLS patients began treatment with 100 mg dipyridamole (with uptitration to 400 mg if necessary). Multiple Suggested Immobilization Tests and polysomnography were performed at baseline and at eight weeks. Severity was assessed at four and eight weeks using the IRLS, and the CGI scales. The primary endpoint was therapeutic response (50% improvement in IRLS total score). Results. Thirteen patients completed the study. IRLS score improved from a mean (±S.D.) of 23.4 ± 4.6 at baseline to 10.7 ± 4.5 at eight weeks. Six out of 13 patients were full responders and four were partial responders. The mean (±S.D.) effective dose of dipyridamole at eight weeks was 281.8 ± 57.5 mg/day. Sleep variables also improved, and the mean (±S.D.) periodic leg movement index decreased from 26.7 ± 7.2 to 4.3 ± 1.9. Dipyridamole was generally well tolerated. Main side effects were abdominal cramps, diarrhea, dizziness, and flushing. Conclusions. These preliminary results suggest that dipyridamole has significant therapeutic effects on both sensory and motor symptoms, as well as sleep. In addition, it provides evidence that hypoadenosinergic mechanisms play a central role in RLS. Classification of evidence. The study provides class III evidence supporting the therapeutic effects of dipyridamole in RLS.;Mental, behavioural or neurodevelopmental disorders;Interventional;Indication out-of-domain;Test
446;29734488;Virtual reality exposure versus prolonged exposure for PTSD: Which treatment for whom?;Background. The majority of studies comparing active psychological treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) do not find significant differences at posttreatment. This was the case in a recent trial examining prolonged exposure (PE) and virtual reality exposure (VRE) among active-duty soldiers with combat-related PTSD. Matching individual patients to specific treatments provides a potential avenue to improve significantly the public health impact of effective treatments for PTSD. A composite moderator approach was used to identify profiles of patients who would see superior PTSD symptom reduction in VRE or PE to inform future treatment matching. Methods. Active duty U.S. army soldiers (N = 108) were enrolled in a randomized clinical trial comparing VRE and PE in the treatment of PTSD stemming from deployments to Iraq or Afghanistan. Eighteen baseline variables were examined to identify treatment response heterogeneity in two patient groups: those with a superior response to PE and those with a superior response to VRE. The final composite moderator comprised four of 18 baseline variables. Results. Results revealed that patients who were predicted to see greater PTSD symptom reduction in VRE were likely to be younger, not taking antidepressant medication, had greater PTSD hyperarousal symptoms, and were more likely to have greater than minimal suicide risk. Conclusions. Results suggest that treatment matching based on patient profiles could meaningfully improve treatment efficacy for combat-related PTSD. Future research can build on these results to improve our understanding of how to improve treatment matching for PTSD.;Mental, behavioural or neurodevelopmental disorders;Interventional;Indication out-of-domain;Test
447;30335626;Cognitive Effects of Perioperative Pregabalin: Secondary Exploratory Analysis of a Randomized Placebo-controlled Study.;"Background. Pregabalin has shown opioid sparing and analgesic effects in the early postoperative period; however, perioperative effects on cognition have not been studied. A randomized, parallel group, placebo-controlled investigation in 80 donor nephrectomy patients was previously performed that evaluated the analgesic, opioid-sparing, and antihyperalgesic effects of pregabalin. This article describes a secondary exploratory analysis that tested the hypothesis that pregabalin would impair cognitive function compared to placebo. Methods. Eighty patients scheduled for donor nephrectomy participated in this randomized, placebo-controlled study. Pregabalin (150 mg twice daily, n = 40) or placebo (n = 40) was administered on the day of surgery and the first postoperative day, in addition to a pain regimen consisting of opioids, steroids, local anesthetics, and acetaminophen. Specific cognitive tests measuring inhibition, sustained attention, psychomotor speed, visual memory, and strategy were performed at baseline, 24 h, and 3 to 5 days after surgery, using tests from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery. Results. In the spatial working memory within errors test, the number of errors increased with pregabalin compared to placebo 24 h after surgery; median (25th, 75th percentile) values were 1 (0, 6) versus 0 (0, 1; rate ratio [95% CI], 3.20 [1.55 to 6.62]; P = 0.002). Furthermore, pregabalin significantly increased the number of errors in the stop-signal task stop-go test compared with placebo; median (25th, 75th percentile) values were 3 (1, 6) versus 1 (0, 2; rate ratio, 2.14 [1.13 to 4.07]; P = 0.020). There were no significant differences between groups in the paired associated learning, reaction time, rapid visual processing, or spatial working memory strategy tests. Conclusions. Perioperative pregabalin significantly negatively affected subdomains of executive functioning, including inhibition, and working memory compared to placebo, whereas psychomotor speed was not changed.";Mental, behavioural or neurodevelopmental disorders;Interventional;Indication out-of-domain;Test

To investigate the safety and efficacy of lofexidine for treating opioid withdrawal syndrome (OWS) and facilitating completion of opioid withdrawal. Methods. A multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted at 18 US centers from June 2013 to December 2014. Participants (n = 603) aged ≥18 years, dependent on short-acting opioids, and seeking withdrawal treatment, randomized 3:3:2 to receive lofexidine 2.88 mg/d (n = 222), lofexidine 2.16 mg/d (n = 230), or placebo (n = 151) for 7 days. Primary outcome was the Short Opiate Withdrawal Scale of Gossop (SOWS-Gossop) scores rating withdrawal symptoms over days 1 to 7. Results. Participants were of mean age, 35 years; 71% male. Pairwise differences in overall SOWS-Gossop log-transformed least squares means were statistically significant for lofexidine 2.16 mg (difference, -0.21; 95% CI, -0.37 to -0.04; P = 0.02) and 2.88 mg (-0.26; 95% CI, -0.44 to -0.09; P = 0.003) compared with placebo. Fewer than half of participants in both groups completed the study. Completion rates for lofexidine 2.16 mg (41.5%; odds ratio [OR], 1.85; P = 0.007) and 2.88 mg (39.6%; OR, 1.71; P = 0.02) were significantly better compared with placebo (27.8%). Overall adverse event (AE) rates were similar across groups. Common AEs for lofexidine included orthostatic hypotension, hypotension, and bradycardia, but resulted in few study discontinuations. Conclusions. Lofexidine 2.16 mg and 2.88 mg significantly reduced symptoms of OWS versus placebo, and increased absolute rates of completing the 7-day study by 14% and 12%, respectively (a relative increase of 85% and 71%). Data suggest that lofexidine is a generally safe and effective nonopioid treatment for opioid withdrawal. Lofexidine could serve as a withdrawal treatment option when a nonopioid agent is preferred or required, when agonist-assisted withdrawal is unavailable, when agonist discontinuation caused OWS, and during induction into maintenance treatment with opioid agonists or antagonists.

449;31412884;Clinical and cost-effectiveness of contingency management for cannabis use in early psychosis: the CIRCLE randomised clinical trial.;"Background. Cannabis is the most commonly used illicit substance amongst people with psychosis. Continued cannabis use following the onset of psychosis is associated with poorer functional and clinical outcomes. However, finding effective ways of intervening has been very challenging. We examined the clinical and cost-effectiveness of adjunctive contingency management (CM), which involves incentives for abstinence from cannabis use, in people with a recent diagnosis of psychosis. Methods. CIRCLE was a pragmatic multi-centre randomised controlled trial. Participants were recruited via Early Intervention in Psychosis (EIP) services across the Midlands and South East of England. They had had at least one episode of clinically diagnosed psychosis (affective or non-affective); were aged 18 to 36; reported cannabis use in at least 12 out of the previous 24 weeks; and were not currently receiving treatment for cannabis misuse, or subject to a legal requirement for cannabis testing. Participants were randomised via a secure web-based service 1:1 to either an experimental arm, involving 12 weeks of CM plus a six-session psychoeducation package, or a control arm receiving the psychoeducation package only. The total potential voucher reward in the CM intervention was £240. The primary outcome was time to acute psychiatric care, operationalised as admission to an acute mental health service (including community alternatives to admission). Primary outcome data were collected from patient records at 18 months post-consent by assessors masked to allocation. The trial was registered with the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN33576045. Results. Five hundred fifty-one participants were recruited between June 2012 and April 2016. Primary outcome data were obtained for 272 (98%) in the CM (experimental) group and 259 (95%) in the control group. There was no statistically significant difference in time to acute psychiatric care (the primary outcome) (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.76, 1.40) between groups. By 18 months, 90 (33%) of participants in the CM group, and 85 (30%) of the control groups had been admitted at least once to an acute psychiatric service. Amongst those who had experienced an acute psychiatric admission, the median time to admission was 196 days (IQR 82, 364) in the CM group and 245 days (IQR 99, 382) in the control group. Cost-effectiveness analyses suggest that there is an 81% likelihood that the intervention was cost-effective, mainly resulting from higher mean inpatient costs for the control group compared with the CM group; however, the cost difference between groups was not statistically significant. There were 58 adverse events, 27 in the CM group and 31 in the control group. Conclusions. Overall, these results suggest that CM is not an effective intervention for improving the time to acute psychiatric admission or reducing cannabis use in psychosis, at least at the level of voucher reward offered.";Mental, behavioural or neurodevelopmental disorders;Interventional;Indication out-of-domain;Test

To determine whether the effects of an exercise programme in patients with osteoarthritis of hip or knee are sustained at six and nine months' follow up. Methods. A randomised, single blind, clinical trial was conducted in a primary care setting. Patients with osteoarthritis of hip or knee (ACR criteria) were selected. Two intervention groups were compared. Both groups received treatment from their general practitioner, including patient education and drug treatment if necessary. The experimental group also received exercise treatment from a physiotherapist in primary care. The treatment period was 12 weeks, with an ensuing 24 week follow up. The main outcome measures were pain, drug use (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), and observed disability. Results. 201 patients were randomly allocated to the exercise or control group, and 183 patients completed the trial. At 24 weeks exercise treatment was associated with a small to moderate effect on pain during the past week (difference in change between the two groups -11.5 (95% CI -19.7 to -3.3). At 36 weeks no differences were found between the groups. Conclusions.

OSKIRA-4 evaluated the efficacy of fostamatinib monotherapy versus placebo on the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis over 6 weeks by Disease Activity Score C reactive protein (DAS-28(CRP)) and assessed non-inferiority to adalimumab monotherapy at Week 24 by DAS-28(CRP). Methods. Overall, 279 patients not currently taking disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs were randomised to: (A) fostamatinib 100 mg twice daily for 24 weeks plus placebo injection every 2 weeks (PBOI); (B) fostamatinib 100 mg twice daily for 4 weeks, then 150 mg once daily up to Week 24, plus PBOI; (C) fostamatinib 100 mg twice daily for 4 weeks, then 100 mg once daily up to Week 24, plus PBOI; (D) adalimumab 40 mg every 2 weeks for 24 weeks, plus oral placebo twice daily; or (E) oral placebo twice daily for 6 weeks, plus PBOI, then a switch to arm A or B. Results. Fostamatinib demonstrated a significant improvement in DAS-28(CRP) score from baseline versus placebo at Week 6 for arms A and B, but not C. Fostamatinib was significantly less effective than adalimumab at Week 24 based on DAS-28(CRP). Adverse events observed with fostamatinib treatment were consistent with those reported in previous studies, including hypertension and diarrhoea. Conclusions. Fostamatinib demonstrated efficacy as monotherapy, showing superior DAS-28(CRP) score changes between baseline and 6 weeks when compared with placebo in treatment arms A and B. However, all fostamatinib regimens demonstrated inferior responses compared with adalimumab at Week 24. Trial registration number.

452;25381300;Treatment of sporadic inclusion body myositis with bimagrumab.;"Objective. To study activin signaling and its blockade in sporadic inclusion body myositis (sIBM) through translational studies and a randomized controlled trial. Methods. We measured transforming growth factor β signaling by SMAD2/3 phosphorylation in muscle biopsies of 50 patients with neuromuscular disease (17 with sIBM). We tested inhibition of activin receptors IIA and IIB (ActRII) in 14 patients with sIBM using one dose of bimagrumab (n = 11) or placebo (n = 3). The primary outcome was the change in right thigh muscle volume by MRI at 8 weeks. Lean body mass, strength, and function were secondary outcomes. Twelve of the patients (10 bimagrumab, 2 placebo) participated in a subsequent 16-week observation phase. Results. Muscle SMAD2/3 phosphorylation was higher in sIBM than in other muscle diseases studied (p = 0.003). Eight weeks after dosing, the bimagrumab-treated patients increased thigh muscle volume (right leg +6.5% compared with placebo, p = 0.024; left leg +7.6%, p = 0.009) and lean body mass (+5.7% compared with placebo, p = 0.014). Subsequently, bimagrumab-treated patients had improved 6-minute walking distance, which peaked at 16 weeks (+14.6%, p = 0.008) compared with placebo. There were no serious adverse events; the main adverse events with bimagrumab were mild acne and transient involuntary muscle contractions. Conclusions. Transforming growth factor β superfamily signaling, at least through ActRII, is implicated in the pathophysiology of sIBM. Inhibition of ActRII increased muscle mass and function in this pilot trial, offering a potential novel treatment of sIBM. Classification of evidence. This study provides Class I evidence that for patients with inclusion body myositis, bimagrumab increases thigh muscle volume at 8 weeks.";Musculoskeletal system or connective tissue diseases;Interventional;Indication out-of-domain;Test
453;25771371;Pharmacokinetic, Dosimetry and Toxicity Study of ¹⁷⁷Lu-EDTMP in Patients: Phase 0/I study.;177Lu-EDTMP has been proposed as a potent bone pain palliation agent owing to theoretical advantage of reduced bone marrow suppression resulting from the low β(-) energy and a suitably long half-life facilitating its wider distribution with less loss from radioactive decay. Herein, we report the pharmacokinetics, dosimetry and toxicity analysis of 177Lu-EDTMP in patients (phase-0/I study). In a phase-0 study, the biokinetics of skeletal and non-skeletal uptake of 177Lu-EDTMP was assessed in 6 patients with metastatic prostate cancer using tracer doses (172.7-206.9MBq). Data of whole skeletal uptake, blood and fractionated urine samples were obtained and dosimetric calculations were performed using the OLINDA/EXM 1.0 software. Prolonged bone retention was observed in all patients. Excretion was mainly via the renal route and blood clearance was rapid and biphasic. Mean estimated red marrow dose was 0.80±0.15mGy/MBq while mean total-body dose was 0.16±0.04mGy/MBq. A maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 2000-3250MBqfor 177Lu-EDTMP was calculated. For the phase-I study, 21 patients with metastatic prostate cancer were given a therapeutic dose of 177Lu- EDTMP (692-5550MBq). Toxiciy (WHO), evaluated by assessment of hemoglobin levels, platelet and leukocyte counts over 12 weeks, was mainly limited to anemia or thrombocytopenia. Only transient toxicity was observed in 14/21 patients, of which 6 had baseline toxicity. Beyond the MTD, a significantly higher number of patients displayed grade 3-4 toxicity. Pain relief, assessed by VAS pain score, was observed in 86% patients with median relief duration of 7 weeks. The results demonstrate that 177Lu-EDTMP has excellent pharmacokinetic and dosimetric properties, besides being safe and effective. Along with estimating radiation dose values to certain critical organs, we have also proposed an MTD for 177Lu-EDTMP that correlated well with toxicity data. The encouraging dosimetry and toxicity data of 177Lu-EDTMP reported provide the basis for subsequent phases of the studies to establish complete effectiveness and safety of 177Lu-EDTMP as an attractive alternative to other radioactive bone pain palliation agents.;Musculoskeletal system or connective tissue diseases;Interventional;Indication out-of-domain;Test
454;26489704;Clinical and radiographic outcome of a treat-to-target strategy using methotrexate and intra-articular glucocorticoids with or without adalimumab induction: a 2-year investigator-initiated, double-blinded, randomised, controlled trial (OPERA).;"Objectives. To study clinical and radiographic outcomes after withdrawing 1 year's adalimumab induction therapy for early rheumatoid arthritis (eRA) added to a methotrexate and intra-articular triamcinolone hexacetonide treat-to-target strategy (NCT00660647). Methods. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD)-naive patients with eRA started methotrexate (20 mg/week) and intra-articular triamcinolone (20 mg/ml) for 2 years. In addition, they were randomised to receive placebo adalimumab (DMARD group, n=91) or adalimumab (40 mg/every other week) (DMARD+adalimumab group, n=89) during the first year. Sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine were added if disease activity persisted after 3 months. During year 2, synthetic DMARDs continued. Adalimumab was (re)initiated if active disease reoccurred. Clinical response, remission, disability, quality of life and radiographic changes were assessed. Results. One year after adalimumab withdrawal, treatment profiles and clinical responses did not differ between groups. In the DMARD/DMARD+adalimumab groups, the median 2-year methotrexate dose was 20/20 mg/week (p=0.45), triple DMARD therapy had been initiated in 33/27 patients (p=0.49), adalimumab was (re)initiated in 12/12 patients and cumulative triamcinolone dose was 160/120 mg (p=0.15). The treatment target (disease activity score, 4 variables, C-reactive protein (DAS28CRP) ≤3.2 or DAS28>3.2 without swollen joints) was achieved at all visits in ≥85% of patients in year 2; remission rates were DAS28CRP<2.6:69%/66%; Clinical Disease Activity Index ≤2.8:55%/57%; Simplified Disease Activity Index <3.3:54%/49%; American College of Rheumatology/European League against Rheumatism (28 joints):44%/45% (p=0.66-1.00). Radiographic progression (Δtotal Sharp score/year) was similar 1.31/0.53 (p=0.12). Erosive progression (Δerosion score (ES)/year) was year 1:0.57/0.06 (p=0.02); year 2:0.38/0.05 (p=0.005). Proportion of patients without erosive progression (ΔES≤0) was year 1: 59%/76% (p=0.03); year 2:64%/79% (p=0.04). Conclusions. An aggressive triamcinolone and synthetic DMARD treat-to-target strategy in eRA provided excellent 2-year clinical and radiographic disease control independent of adalimumab induction therapy. ES progression was slightly less during and following adalimumab induction therapy. Trial registration number.

455;26727655;Doubling the single-dose infusion rate of tocilizumab in rheumatoid arthritis is safe and efficacious.;Objectives. To investigate the impact of enhanced infusion rate of tocilizumab on the occurrence of infusion reactions, overall safety, and efficacy in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Method. We conducted a 24-week multicentre, open-label, randomized parallel group study comparing adverse event (AE) and effect profiles following tocilizumab IV 8 mg/kg every 4 weeks over 31 min vs. standard 60-min infusions in patients with RA and an inadequate clinical response to disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and/or tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α inhibitors. Results. A total of 47 patients were enrolled in the study and randomized to fast infusions (n = 25) and controls (n = 22). Incidences of infusion reactions were similar between the two groups, neither of them leading to withdrawal. Likewise, the incidence of additional AEs did not differ between the treatment arms. Two serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported, in the control group. Four patients withdrew due to AEs, two from each arm. Efficacy at week 24 was comparable between groups. Conclusions. In RA, monthly tocilizumab infusions of 8 mg/kg provided over 31 or 60 min during 24 weeks did not differ concerning safety or efficacy.;Musculoskeletal system or connective tissue diseases;Interventional;Indication out-of-domain;Test
456;28987470;Potential therapeutic impact of omega-3 long chain-polyunsaturated fatty acids on inflammation markers in Duchenne muscular dystrophy: A double-blind, controlled randomized trial.;"Background & aims. Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is the most frequent dystrophy in childhood generated by a deficiency in dystrophin. DMD is a neuromuscular disease and its clinical course comprises chronic inflammation and gradual muscle weakness. Supplementation of omega-3 long chain-Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (ω-3 long chain-PUFA) reduces inflammatory markers in various disorders. The goal of this research was to analyze the influence of ω-3 long chain-PUFA intake on gene expression and blood inflammatory markers in boys with DMD. Methods. In a placebo-controlled, double. Blind, randomized trial, boys with DMD (n = 36) consumed 2.9 g/day of ω-3 long chain-PUFA or sunflower oil as control, in capsules, for a period of 6 months. Blood was analyzed at baseline and at months 1, 2, 3, and 6 of supplementation for expression of inflammatory markers in leukocytes and serum. Results. There was high adherence to capsule intake (control: 95.3% ± 7.2%, and ω-3 long chain-PUFA: 97.4% ± 3.7% at month 6). Enrichment of EicosaPentaenoic Acid (EPA) and DocosaHexaenoic Acid (DHA) in erythrocytes increased significantly in patients supplemented with ω-3 long chain-PUFA compared with the placebo group during the 6 months of supplementation. Messenger RNA (mRNA) of the Nuclear Factor kappa beta (NF-κB) and its target genes InterLeukin 1 beta (IL-1β) and IL-6 was downregulated significantly (p < 0.05) in leukocytes from DMD boys supplemented with ω-3 long chain-PUFA for 6 months, compared to the placebo group. Omega-3 long chain-PUFA intake decreased the serum IL-1β (-59.5%; p = 0.011) and IL-6 (-54.8%; p = 0.041), and increased the serum IL-10 (99.9%, p < 0.005), in relation to those with placebo treatment. Conclusion. Supplementation with ω-3 long chain-PUFA 2.9 g/day is well-tolerated, has a beneficial reductive effect on proinflammatory markers, and increases an anti-inflammatory marker, indicating that ω-3 long chain-PUFA could have a potential therapeutic impact on chronic inflammation in DMD.

457;29087367;Which Combination Treatment Is Better for Spinal Metastasis: Percutaneous Vertebroplasty With Radiofrequency Ablation, 125I Seed, Zoledronic Acid, or Radiotherapy?;Background. Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) can not only alleviate pain but also restore mechanical stability with injection of bone cement, whereas it exhibits a poor effect on antitumor activity. But through combinations with other therapies, it may be possible to achieve the maximum effect in clinical treatment. Thus, this study is designed to assess the clinical efficacy of PVP separately combined with 4 ways for spinal metastasis (SM) treatment. Study question. Which combination treatment is better for spinal metastasis, percutaneous vertebroplasty with radiofrequency ablation, I seed, zoledronic acid or radiotherapy? Study design. A total of 169 patients with SM were retrospectively recruited and randomly assigned to 4 groups to receive 4 different ways separately: 49 patients (group A) received PVP plus I seed, 51 (group B) received PVP plus radiofrequency ablation (RFA), 38 (group C) underwent PVP plus zoledronic acid (ZA), and 31 (group D) underwent PVP plus radiotherapy (RT). Measures and outcomes. All of them underwent routine examinations before operation. Visual analog scale (VAS), World Health Organization (WHO) Pain Relief, and ODI were applied to evaluate pain relief and motor function. Results. PVP plus RT achieved the best efficacy in relieving pains, with the highest WHO Pain Relief (P < 0.05). The PVP plus RFA exhibited lowest ODI, suggesting the best outcome after treatment (P < 0.05). The PVP plus I showed the lowest VAS score, but it was the worst to improve the routine exercise ability and relieve pains from patients. The PVP plus ZA presented higher VAS and ODI (P < 0.05). Conclusions. PVP combined with I seed exhibited the best clinical efficacy in terms of VAS, PVP combined with RT was the best choice in terms of WHO Pain Relief, and PVP combined with RFA showed the best effect in terms of ODI for the treatment of SM.;Musculoskeletal system or connective tissue diseases;Interventional;Indication out-of-domain;Test

Loxoprofen (LOX) is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). Although oral administration of LOX has been widely prescribed, clinical guidelines for osteoarthritis generally recommend topical rather than oral NSAIDs in specific patients. However, there is limited information on the effects of loxoprofen sodium oral (LOX-O) versus loxoprofen sodium hydrogel transdermal patch (LOX-T) in myalgia patients. Hence, this non-inferiority study was designed to compare the efficacy and safety of LOX-O versus LOX-T in Chinese patients with myalgia. Methods. In this double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial, 182 Chinese patients were enrolled and randomized equally to either LOX-T or LOX-O treatment for 2 weeks. Patients in the LOX-T group applied one sheet of the active LOX-T once a day on the affected site and took one placebo tablet three times a day immediately after meals, whereas patients in the LOX-O group applied one sheet of the placebo patch once a day and took one active LOX-O three times a day. Primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with 50% overall improvement or higher at the final visit. The cutoff value of a non-inferiority difference was set as - 10%. Results. In the full analysis set, the primary endpoint of final efficacy rate was 81.3% (n = 91) in the LOX-T group and 72.2% (n = 88) in the LOX-O group. The difference between the two groups was 9.1% [95% confidence interval (CI) - 3.1 to 21.3%], which showed that LOX-T was non-inferior compared with LOX-O. No serious adverse events occurred in either group. Conclusions. This trial showed the non-inferiority of LOX-T compared with LOX-O in efficacy and safety in Chinese patients with myalgia. Also, the characteristic features of topical LOX-T, such as better compliance and lower risk-benefit ratio, make it more favorable for clinical practice. Trial registration.

459;32078147;Intramuscular Clodronate in Long-Term Treatment of Symptomatic Knee Osteoarthritis: A Randomized Controlled Study.;"Background and objective. Clodronate is a nitrogen-free bisphosphonate that is widely and effectively used in the treatment of many osteo-metabolic disorders. The objective of our study was to evaluate the effectiveness of clodronate in reducing pain and bone marrow edema in knee osteoarthritis. Methods. In total, 74 patients were included in the study. Group 1 received intramuscular clodronate 200 mg daily for 15 days and then once weekly for the next 11.5 months; group 2 received intramuscular clodronate 200 mg daily for 15 days and then once weekly for the next 2.5 months. Visual analog scale (VAS) scores were recorded at baseline (T0) and after 30 days (T1), 3 months (T2), 6 months (T3), 9 months (T4), and 12 months (end of study; T5). We also evaluated functional status and use of paracetamol (T0, T1, T2, T3, T4, and T5) and changes in Whole Organ Magnetic Resonance Imaging Score (WORMS; T0, T2, and T5). Results. Both groups had a statistically significant reduction in VAS score until 3 months. Group 1 then experienced further VAS reductions, whereas VAS scores for group 2 progressively increased. Pain, stiffness, and physical function also showed the same trend, as did bone marrow edema extension, which was evaluated with WORMS. Conclusion. Our study indicates that intramuscular administration of a therapeutic dose of clodronate followed by a maintenance dose is effective in the management of symptomatic knee osteoarthritis, improving functional outcomes and reducing pain and bone marrow edema.

460;3126410;Valproic acid efficacy, toxicity, and pharmacokinetics in neonates with intractable seizures.;"Six neonates with prolonged, intractable seizures were treated with valproic acid (VPA). Each patient had received maximum doses of phenobarbital (greater than 40 micrograms/ml), and five patients received at least two additional anticonvulsants, without success. Seizure activity was controlled in five of six (83%) cases. In four cases, all other anticonvulsants could be withdrawn, and seizures were controlled on VPA monotherapy. VPA was discontinued in three patients because of VPA-induced hyperammonemia. VPA pharmacokinetic measurements were as follows: for total VPA, volume of distribution (V) = 0.40 l/kg (range, 0.36 to 0.47 l/kg), serum clearance (Cl) = 14.4 ml/h/kg (5.5 to 18.2 ml/h/kg), half-life (T1/2) = 26.4 hours (8.6 to 48.5); for unbound VPA, V = 2.02 l/kg (1.14 to 2.44 l/kg), Cl = 108.9 ml/h/kg (42.0 to 252.0 ml/h/kg).

461;16023510;Safety and efficacy of buccal midazolam versus rectal diazepam for emergency treatment of seizures in children: a randomised controlled trial.;Background. Rectal diazepam and buccal midazolam are used for emergency treatment of acute febrile and afebrile (epileptic) seizures in children. We aimed to compare the safety and efficacy of these drugs. Methods. A multicentre, randomised controlled trial was undertaken to compare buccal midazolam with rectal diazepam for emergency-room treatment of children aged 6 months and older presenting to hospital with active seizures and without intravenous access. The dose varied according to age from 2.5 to 10 mg. The primary endpoint was therapeutic success: cessation of seizures within 10 min and for at least 1 hour, without respiratory depression requiring intervention. Analysis was per protocol. Findings. Consent was obtained for 219 separate episodes involving 177 patients, who had a median age of 3 years (IQR 1-5) at initial episode. Therapeutic success was 56% (61 of 109) for buccal midazolam and 27% (30 of 110) for rectal diazepam (percentage difference 29%, 95% CI 16-41). Analysing only initial episodes revealed a similar result. The rate of respiratory depression did not differ between groups. When centre, age, known diagnosis of epilepsy, use of antiepileptic drugs, prior treatment, and length of seizure before treatment were adjusted for with logistic regression, buccal midazolam was more effective than rectal diazepam. Interpretation. Buccal midazolam was more effective than rectal diazepam for children presenting to hospital with acute seizures and was not associated with an increased incidence of respiratory depression.;Nervous system diseases;Interventional;Indication out-of-domain;Test
462;21208198;Buccal midazolam or rectal diazepam for treatment of residential adult patients with serial seizures or status epilepticus.;"Objectives. To compare the efficacy and tolerability of buccal midazolam with rectal diazepam as emergency treatment in residential adults with convulsive or non-convulsive serial seizures or status epilepticus (SE), and ascertain the preference between the two treatment options among the patients and the nursing staff. Materials and methods. The nursing staff of our residential epilepsy centre treated 80 episodes of serial seizures or SE lasting more than 5 min alternating with rectal diazepam or buccal midazolam. The dose of each study drug was tailored individually. The primary outcome measure was defined as cessation of seizure activity within 10 min without seizure relapse within 2 h. Results. Convulsive SE was treated promptly, after a mean of 6.2 min, and terminated faster with buccal midazolam than with rectal diazepam; i.e. after a mean of 2.8 vs 5.0 min, respectively (n = 0.012). The other subcategories of emergency situations were treated after a mean of 25.0 min, and the seizure activity ceased after a mean of 7.4 min in the diazepam group and 7.6 min in the midazolam group (NS). The success rate was 83.3% in the diazepam group and 74.4% in the midazolam group (NS). The difference was mostly due to slightly more seizure relapses during the first 2 h in the midazolam group. Both treatment options were well tolerated, temporary tiredness being the most frequently occurring adverse effect. All the nursing staff and six of the seven patients who gained experience with both treatment options favoured the buccal route. Conclusions. Buccal midazolam appeared to be at least as effective as rectal diazepam with little or no side effects. The buccal administration was easy to handle and socially more acceptable than the rectal route.";Nervous system diseases;Interventional;Indication out-of-domain;Test

Stimulant medications can enhance mood and cognition in stroke rehabilitation, but human clinical trial results are inconclusive. We sought to prospectively study the effects of levodopa (LD) and/or methylphenidate (MPH) in combination with physiotherapy on mood and cognition following stroke in human subjects. Methods. Ischemic stroke patients were enrolled in our study 15 to 180 days after stroke onset. The patients were randomized into four medication groups (MPH, LD, MPH + LD, or placebo) and received a 15-day course of medication therapy (1 dose daily) and 45-min standard physiotherapy treatment daily. Mood and cognitive function were assessed at the study onset and 15, 90 and 180 days after study enrollment. Results. The strongest improvement of mood and cognition was found between baseline and the first follow-up immediately after the intervention. A significant improvement in mood was also found in the combined treatment group (MPH + LD) at 90 and 180 days, compared to the placebo group. Conclusions. A 15-day course of daily MPH + LD combined with physiotherapy over a 3-week period was safe and significantly improved mood status in ischemic stroke patients.

To compare the effectiveness of levetiracetam (LEV) with extended-release sodium valproate (VPA-ER) and controlled-release carbamazepine (CBZ-CR) as monotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy. Methods. This unblinded, randomised, 52-week superiority trial (NCT00175903) recruited patients (≥16 years of age) with ≥2 unprovoked seizures in the previous 2 years and ≥1 in the previous 6 months. The physician chose VPA or CBZ as preferred standard treatment; each patient was randomised to standard treatment or LEV. The primary outcome was time to treatment withdrawal (LEV vs standard antiepileptic drugs (AEDs)). Analyses also compared LEV with VPA-ER, and LEV with CBZ-CR. Findings. 1688 patients (mean age 41 years; 44% female) were randomised to LEV (n=841) or standard AEDs (n=847). Time to treatment withdrawal was not significantly different between LEV and standard AEDs: HR (95% CI) 0.90 (0.74 to 1.08). Time to treatment withdrawal (HR (95% CI)) was 1.02 (0.74 to 1.41) for LEV/VPA-ER and 0.84 (0.66 to 1.07) for LEV/CBZ-CR. Time to first seizure (HR, 95% CI) was significantly longer for standard AEDs, 1.20 (1.03 to 1.39), being 1.19 (0.93 to 1.54) for LEV/VPA-ER and 1.20 (0.99 to 1.46) for LEV/CBZ-CR. Estimated 12-month seizure freedom rates from randomisation: 58.7% LEV versus 64.5% VPA-ER; 50.5% LEV versus 56.7% CBZ-CR. Similar proportions of patients within each stratum reported at least one adverse event: 66.1% LEV versus 62.0% VPA-ER; 73.4% LEV versus 72.5% CBZ-CR. Conclusions.

466;26599796;Saline Flush After Rocuronium Bolus Reduces Onset Time and Prolongs Duration of Effect: A Randomized Clinical Trial.;"Background. Circulatory factors modify the onset time of neuromuscular-blocking drugs. Therefore, we hypothesized that infusion of a saline flush immediately after rocuronium administration would shorten the onset time without influencing the duration of the rocuronium effect. Methods. Forty-eight patients were randomly allocated to the control or saline flush group. Anesthesia was induced and maintained with propofol and remifentanil, and all patients received 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium in 10 mL of normal saline. In the saline flush group, 20 mL normal saline was immediately infused after rocuronium administration. Neuromuscular blockade was assessed using acceleromyography at the adductor pollicis muscle with train-of-four (TOF) stimulation. The neuromuscular indices for rocuronium were calculated as follows: the latent onset time, defined as the time from the start of rocuronium infusion until first occurrence of depression of the first twitch of the TOF (T1) ≥5%; onset time, defined as the time from the start of rocuronium infusion until first occurrence of depression of the T1 ≥95%; clinical duration, defined as the time from the start of rocuronium administration until T1 recovered to 25% of the final T1 value; recovery index, defined as the time for recovery of T1 from 25% to 75% of the final T1 value; and the total recovery time, defined as the time from the start of rocuronium administration until reaching a TOF ratio of 0.9. Significance was designated at P <0.05. Results. The measured latent onset time and onset time were significantly shorter in the saline flush group than the control group by 15 seconds (95.2% confidence interval, 0-15, P = 0.007) and 15 seconds (0-30, P = 0.018), respectively. Saline flush significantly depressed the T1 height at 30, 45, and 60 seconds after the rocuronium bolus by 17%, 24%, and 14%, respectively. In addition, the recovery phase was significantly prolonged in the saline flush group. The mean clinical duration (5th-95th percentile range) in the saline flush group and control group was 35 minutes (27-63 minutes) and 31 minutes (19-48 minutes; P = 0.032), respectively; the recovery index was 13 minutes (8-25 minutes) and 10 minutes (7-19 minutes; P = 0.019), respectively; and the total recovery time was 61 minutes (44-108 minutes) and 50 minutes (35-93 minutes; P = 0.048), respectively. Conclusions. Administering a 20-mL saline flush immediately after infusion of 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium in 10 mL normal saline shortened the onset time and prolonged the recovery phase of neuromuscular blockade.";Nervous system diseases;Interventional;Indication out-of-domain;Test
467;27598679;Transvenous neurostimulation for central sleep apnoea: a randomised controlled trial.;"Background Central sleep apnoea is a serious breathing disorder associated with poor outcomes. The remede system (Respicardia Inc, Minnetonka, MN, USA) is an implantable device which transvenously stimulates a nerve causing diaphragmatic contraction similar to normal breathing. We evaluated the safety and effectiveness of unilateral neurostimulation in patients with central sleep apnoea. Methods We recruited patients from 31 hospital-based centres in Germany, Poland, and the USA in this prospective, multicentre, randomised trial. Participants had to have been medically stable for at least 30 days and have received appropriate guideline recommended therapy, be aged at least 18 years, be expected to tolerate study procedures, and willing and able to comply with study requirements. Eligible patients with an apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI) of at least 20 events per h, tested by a polysomnography, underwent device implantation and were randomly assigned (1:1) by a computer-generated method stratified by site to either stimulation (treatment) or no stimulation (control) for 6 months. The primary effectiveness endpoint in the intention-to-treat population was the comparison of the proportions of patients in the treatment versus control groups achieving a 50% or greater AHI reduction from baseline to 6 months, measured by a full-night polysomnography assessed by masked investigators in a core laboratory. The primary safety endpoint of 12-month freedom from serious adverse events related to the procedure, system, or therapy was evaluated in all patients. This trial is active, but not recruiting, and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01816776). Findings Between April 17, 2013, and May 28, 2015, we randomly assigned 151 eligible patients to the treatment (n=73) or control (n=78) groups. In the analysis of the intention-to-treat population, significantly more patients in the treatment group (35 [51%] of 68) had an AHI reduction from baseline of 50% or greater at 6 months than had those in the control group (eight [11%] of 73; difference between groups 41%, 95% CI 25-54, p<0·0001). 138 (91%) of 151 patients had no serious-related adverse events at 12 months. Seven (9%) cases of related-serious adverse events occurred in the control group and six (8%) cases were reported in the treatment group. Seven patients died (unrelated to implant, system, or therapy), four deaths (two in treatment group and two in control group) during the 6-month randomisation period when neurostimulation was delivered to only the treatment group and was off in the control group, and three deaths between 6 months and 12 months of follow-up when all patients received neurostimulation. 27 (37%) of 73 patients in the treatment group reported non-serious therapy-related discomfort that was resolved with simple system reprogramming in 26 (36%) patients, but was unresolved in one (1%) patient. Interpretation Transvenous neurostimulation significantly reduced the severity of central sleep apnoea, including improvements in sleep metrics, and was well tolerated. The clinically meaningful effects of the therapy are supported by the concordant improvements in oxygenation and quality of life, making transvenous neurostimulation a promising therapeutic approach for central sleep apnoea.

468;28086137;Comparative study of therapeutic response to baclofen vs tolperisone in spasticity.;"Spasticity from the upper motor neuron syndrome can result from a variety of conditions affecting the cortex or spinal cord. Some of the more common conditions associated with spasticity include spinal cord injury, cerebral palsy, and post-stroke syndrome. In this study we compared the efficacy and safety of baclofen vs tolperisone in spasticity. One hundred fifty patients with cerebral palsy or post stroke or spinal cord injury associated spasticity were enrolled in present study. Group I comprised of Seventy-five patients receiving baclofen and group II comprised of 75 patients receiving tolperisone. For efficacy measurement 4 evaluation methods were used, 1) Modified Ashworth Scale for muscle tone, 2) Medical research council scale for muscle strength and 3) Barthel Index for functional outcome 4) Coefficient of efficacy. In efficacy evaluation, both groups showed significant improvement in muscle tone, muscle strength and functional outcome at week 6 (Group I, 1.55±0.053, 2.79+0.032, 59.31±1.32; Group II, 1.57±0.053, 3.04±0.032, 73±1.32 respectively). In between the group analysis, there was no significant difference in muscle tone improvement in both the groups after 6 weeks (Group I, 1.055±0.053 vs Group II, 1.57±0.053, p>0.05). Group II showed non-significant but greater improvement in muscle strength (Week 6; Group I, 2.79±0.032 vs Group II, 3.04±0.032, p>0.07). Improvement in functional outcomes was greater in group II as compared to group I (Group I, 59.31±1.32 vs Group II, 73±1.32, p<0.05). Overall efficacy coefficient was greater for group II (3.6) as compared to group I (2.3). Baclofen showed more side effects compared to tolperisone in, asthenia being the most frequent. Tolperisone offers greater improvement in activities of daily living compared to baclofen.

469;29957441;Comparison of lamotrigine and oxcarbazepine monotherapy for pediatric focal epilepsy: An observational study.;Purpose. Oxcarbazepine is known as an effective first-line monotherapy for pediatric focal epilepsy. Lamotrigine has also been reported to have similar efficacy to and better tolerability than carbamazepine. Therefore, the effectiveness of oxcarbazepine and lamotrigine monotherapies was compared in patients with pediatric focal epilepsy. Method. A total of 116 patients in pediatric patients with partial epilepsy received lamotrigine (n = 43) or oxcarbazepine (n = 73) monotherapy. The clinical characteristics, seizure outcomes, reasons for drug discontinuation, retention rate and adverse effects were evaluated for each drug. Results. Oxcarbazepine was more commonly used than lamotrigine (69/73 vs. 23/43) as initial monotherapy. Lamotrigine showed better efficacy than oxcarbazepine in terms of the seizure outcome more than 12 months (P<0.05). Oxcarbazepine and lamotrigine showed similar tolerability in terms of the retention rate, drug discontinuation and adverse effects. The rates of successful discontinuation were similar for patients receiving these drug as initial monotherapy (P > 0.05). The seizure outcome was much better for lamotrigine than for oxcarbazepine in patients with normal MRI findings and normal development (P = 0.001, P = 0.01). The retention rate was high in patients with MRI abnormalities or developmental delay in the lamotrigine group. The choice of lamotrigine was the only independent variable that predicted a seizure-free state, even after correcting for clinical variables (OR = 4.80, P = 0.013). Conclusions. Lamotrigine was superior to oxcarbazepine monotherapy because of its greater effectiveness in treating pediatric focal epilepsy. Lamotrigine can be selected as a first-line monotherapy in patients with or without abnormal MRI findings or delayed development.;Nervous system diseases;Interventional;Indication out-of-domain;Test
470;3126220;Double-blind comparison of terfenadine, chlorpheniramine, and placebo in the treatment of chronic idiopathic urticaria.;The efficacy of terfenadine, a nonsedating H1 antihistamine, in the management of chronic idiopathic urticaria was compared with chlorpheniramine and placebo in a parallel multicenter trial. Subjects with symptoms of hives for 3 days per week for at least 6 weeks were initially screened and admitted if no identifiable cause for symptoms could be determined. Patients entered a single-blind placebo period, and if hives of moderate severity were present for at least 3 days during the week, they were randomly assigned in a double-blind fashion to take terfenadine, 60 mg twice daily, chlorpheniramine, 4 mg three times a day, or placebo for 6 weeks. Data were analyzed for 122 patients. Those patients receiving both active treatments noted significant improvement in symptoms: pruritus, redness, number of hives, and waking hours during which hives were present, at the end of the first day of therapy. Symptom control by terfenadine was statistically superior to placebo during all 6 weeks, as rated by both patients and investigators. However, statistical significance was not achieved for chlorpheniramine at all observation points. Diphenhydramine was permitted as a relief medication for refractory symptoms and was taken by 52% of subjects receiving placebo, 26% taking chlorpheniramine, and only 9% of patients who were receiving terfenadine. In addition to providing superior symptom control, terfenadine caused less drowsiness and fatigue than chlorpheniramine. Terfenadine is a useful therapeutic agent for primary management of chronic idiopathic urticaria.;Skin diseases;Interventional;Indication out-of-domain;Test

The safety profile of tacrolimus makes it a promising therapeutic option for dermatitis. To evaluate and compare the therapeutic ability of tacrolimus 0.1% ointment and mometasone furoate 0.1% ointment in patients with chronic hand eczema and positive patch tests. Thirty adults with chronic hand eczema and positive patch test reaction to relevant contact allergens were treated with tacrolimus 0.1% ointment or mometasone furoate 0.1% ointment in a single-centre, randomized comparative study. The scores of the evaluated clinical parameters (erythema, infiltration, vesiculation, desquamation, presence of cracks and itching) did not differ between Groups A and B at any of the four time points (p>0.05).On the other hand, in both groups, a significant difference was detected in all parameters between baseline and Day 90 recorded values. Tacrolimus is a promising alternative therapy for contact dermatitis patients as it is effective from the first month of treatment, well tolerated and offers similar therapeutic results to topical corticosteroid therapy.;Skin diseases;Interventional;Indication out-of-domain;Test
472;25102893;Open-label exploratory study of acitretin for the treatment of severe chronic hand dermatitis.;"Introduction. Acitretin is a retinoid approved for the treatment of psoriasis that has good efficacy for palmoplantar psoriasis. The safety and efficacy of acitretin in severe chronic hand dermatitis (CHD) is unknown. Methods. A total of nine patients with severe CHD were enrolled and treated with acitretin 10 mg once daily which could be increased to 30 mg daily if well-tolerated. Patients were treated for up to 24 or 12 weeks if the physician global assessment (PGA) was clear or almost clear at that time. CHD severity was evaluated using a 5-grade PGA scale and the modified total lesion symptom score (mTLSS). Results. The proportion of patients achieving PGA of clear or almost clear was 33.3% (95% CI: 9-69%) and the proportion achieving PGA of clear, almost clear or mild was 44% (95% CI: 15-77%). The mTLSS decreased by 45% (-6.3 ± 4.7; p = 0.02). Three patients did not complete the study: one due to an increase in facial dermatitis, one due to lack of efficacy and one who withdrew consent. Conclusions. This pilot study suggests that acitretin could improve severe CHD. Further studies are needed to better assess the efficacy and safety of acitretin in patients with severe CHD.";Skin diseases;Interventional;Indication out-of-domain;Test
473;25533576;Pirfenidone gel in patients with localized scleroderma: a phase II study.;Introduction. Localized scleroderma is an inflammatory disease in its first stages and a fibrotic process in later stages, principally mediated by the transforming growth factor β. To date, there is no standard treatment. The objective of this study was to determine the effectiveness and safety of 8% pirfenidone gel in patients with localized scleroderma. Methods. This was an open phase II clinical trial that included 12 patients. Treatment with pirfenidone was indicated, three times daily for 6 months. Patients were evaluated clinically with the modified Localized Scleroderma Skin Severity Index (mLoSSI), as well with a durometer and histologically using hematoxylin and eosin stain and Masson's trichrome stain. Results. The baseline mLoSSI average scores were 5.83 ± 4.80 vs. 0.83 ± 1.75 (P = 0.002) at 6 months. The initial durometer induration of the scleroderma plaques was 35.79 ± 9.10 vs. 32.47 ± 8.97 at 6 months (P = 0.05). We observed histopathological improvement with respect to epidermal atrophy, inflammation, dermal or adipose tissue fibrosis and annex atrophy from 12.25 ± 3.25 to 9.75 ± 4.35 (P = 0.032). The 8% pirfenidone gel application was well tolerated, and no side effects were detected. Conclusions. This is the first study on the therapeutic use of pirfenidone gel in localized scleroderma. It acts on both the inflammatory and the fibrotic phases. Considering its effectiveness, good safety profile and the advantage of topical application, pirfenidone is a treatment option in this condition.;Skin diseases;Interventional;Indication out-of-domain;Test
474;26454361;Efficacy and safety of dupilumab in adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis inadequately controlled by topical treatments: a randomised, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging phase 2b trial.;"Background. Data from early-stage studies suggested that interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 are requisite drivers of atopic dermatitis, evidenced by marked improvement after treatment with dupilumab, a fully-human monoclonal antibody that blocks both pathways. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of several dose regimens of dupilumab in adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis inadequately controlled by topical treatments. Methods. In this randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind study, we enrolled patients aged 18 years or older who had an Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score of 12 or higher at screening (≥16 at baseline) and inadequate response to topical treatments from 91 study centres, including hospitals, clinics, and academic institutions, in Canada, Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Japan, Poland, and the USA. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1:1:1), stratified by severity (moderate or severe, as assessed by Investigator's Global Assessment) and region (Japan vs rest of world) to receive subcutaneous dupilumab: 300 mg once a week, 300 mg every 2 weeks, 200 mg every 2 weeks, 300 mg every 4 weeks, 100 mg every 4 weeks, or placebo once a week for 16 weeks. We used a central randomisation scheme, provided by an interactive voice response system. Drug kits were coded, providing masking to treatment assignment, and allocation was concealed. Patients on treatment every 2 weeks and every 4 weeks received volume-matched placebo every week when dupilumab was not given to ensure double blinding. The primary outcome was efficacy of dupilumab dose regimens based on EASI score least-squares mean percentage change (SE) from baseline to week 16. Analyses included all randomly assigned patients who received one or more doses of study drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01859988. Findings. Between May 15, 2013, and Jan 27, 2014, 452 patients were assessed for eligibility, and 380 patients were randomly assigned. 379 patients received one or more doses of study drug (300 mg once a week [n=63], 300 mg every 2 weeks [n=64], 200 mg every 2 weeks [n=61], 300 mg every 4 weeks [n=65], 100 mg every 4 weeks [n=65]; placebo [n=61]). EASI score improvements favoured all dupilumab regimens versus placebo (p<0·0001): 300 mg once a week (-74% [SE 5·16]), 300 mg every 2 weeks (-68% [5·12]), 200 mg every 2 weeks (-65% [5·19]), 300 mg every 4 weeks (-64% [4·94]), 100 mg every 4 weeks (-45% [4·99]); placebo (-18% [5·20]). 258 (81%) of 318 patients given dupilumab and 49 (80%) of 61 patients given placebo reported treatment-emergent adverse events; nasopharyngitis was the most frequent (28% and 26%, respectively). Interpretation. Dupilumab improved clinical responses in adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in a dose-dependent manner, without significant safety concerns. Our findings show that IL-4 and IL-13 are key drivers of atopic dermatitis. Funding. Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals.";Skin diseases;Interventional;Indication out-of-domain;Test

The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a new ointment containing Hyaluronic Acid and collagenase from non-pathogenic Vibrio alginolyticus. Patients and methods. Double blind, multicenter, controlled clinical trial (no. ISRCTN71239043) conducted to demonstrate the superiority of Hyaluronic Acid-Collagenase applied once a day over placebo in mean reduction of devitalized/fibrinous/slough tissue after 15 days of treatment. 113 patients with venous ulcers were enrolled and randomized to receive active treatment therapy or vehicle preparation. Both arms also received compression therapy. Subjects were assessed at baseline and at 4 different clinical study visits up to a maximum of 30 days. Outcome measures included mean percentage debridement evaluated by digital planimetry, pain during change of dressing measured on a visual analogue scale and adverse event assessment for tolerance. Results. After 15 days the debridement rate in the active group was 67.5% compared to 59% in the placebo group (p = 0.0436). A significantly higher number of patients in the treatment group achieved 100% debridement by day 15 (p = 0.0025) than in the control group, and a higher percentage also demonstrated complete debridement at every other time point. Pain perception was similar in both groups with low levels during medication. No differences in tolerance were observed between groups. Conclusions. Chronic venous ulcers treated with this novel compound of Hyaluronic Acid and collagenase resulted in a significantly higher debridement rate at Day 15 vs. the control group. Hyaluronic Acid-Collagenase was well tolerated and a low degree of pain was perceived during dressing change. The preparation of 0.2% of Hyaluronic acid-collagenase shows significant benefits in the management of chronic ulcers.;Skin diseases;Interventional;Indication out-of-domain;Test
476;29901362;Comparative Study between Talcum and Zinc Oxide Cream for the Prevention of Irritant Contact Diaper Dermatitis in Infants.;"Background. Baby powder which consists of talcum powder (magnesium silicate) as an active ingredient has been popularly used for prevention of irritant contact diaper dermatitis for a long time because it has water absorbent and friction-decreased properties. There are some case reports of its side effects of pulmonary complication from massive inhalation and the risk of ovarian tumors in adult. However the clinical research on the effectiveness of talcum powder for the prevention of diaper dermatitis has not been investigated. Objective. To compare the effectiveness between talcum powder with topical zinc oxide cream for the prevention of irritant diaper dermatitis. Materials and method. Fifty Thai infants at the age of 6-12 months old were randomized. Either topical talcum powder or zinc oxide cream was topically applied to their skin before changing new diapers. The follow-up were conducted at week 0, 2 and 8 to evaluate an occurrence of diaper dermatitis and to collect the median time-to-event data (the duration of disease occurrence). The clinical severity was assessed by using diaper dermatitis severity scoring scale and the side effects were recorded. Results. The average age of the infants was 8.8 months old. The incidence of irritant contact diaper dermatitis from the talcum group was 4 per 1,000 persons-day (95% confidence interval, 95% CI: 2-7) while the incidence of diaper dermatitis from the zinc oxide group was 2 per 1,000 persons-day (95% CI: 1-5). The median time-to-event outcome of diaper dermatitis for the talcum group was 19 days (interquartile range, IQR: 7-29) which was earlier than that of zinc oxide group, which was 39 days (IQR: 30-59). This showed statistically significant difference (p = 0.03, Log rank test). The average of disease duration of the talcum group (mean + SD) was 2.7+0.5 days whereas that of the zinc oxide group was 3.7+3.3 days. There is no significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.34). Most of the severity of the disease found in both groups is mild. The risk evaluation of diaper dermatitis at week 8, determined by using Cox proportional hazard analysis showed that the talcum group had 5.3 times greater risk than the zinc oxide group (hazard ratio, HR; 5.3, 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.4-20.0), with significant group difference (p = 0.01). There was no adverse effect detected on both groups. Conclusion. Topical zinc oxide cream was better than talcum powder for the prevention of irritant contact diaper dermatitis.";Skin diseases;Interventional;Indication out-of-domain;Test

The patients were randomly divided into the treatment group (n = 56) and the control group (n = 44). The treatment group was medicated with calcium gluconate (10 mg/ time, 1 time/day), vitamin D3 (intramuscular 10 mg/time, 1 time/week), mizolastine (10 mg/time, 1 time/day), and proteoglycan (1.2 g/time, 3 times/day), while the control group was administered with the same drugs except proteoglycan for 4 weeks. After treatment with combined mizolastine and proteoglycan, therapeutic effect with symptoms decline index (SDI) more than 60% was significant different (44 vs. 24, p = 0.000973) and the relapse rate after 2 months was significantly lower (17.9% vs. 38.6%, p = 0.0202). Using ELISA, we found that the IFN-γ (37.88 ± 4.27 pg/mL vs. 21.91 ± 4.95 pg/mL, p = 0.028) levels were specifically increased in the experiment group. The combination of mizolastine plus proteoglycan is effective in treating chronic urticaria with better therapeutic effect and lower relapse rate through promoting IFN-γ production.;Skin diseases;Interventional;Indication out-of-domain;Test
478;31521192;Sustained remission with methotrexate monotherapy after 22-week induction treatment with TNF-alpha inhibitor and methotrexate in early psoriatic arthritis: an open-label extension of a randomized placebo-controlled trial.;Background. If TNF inhibitors are initiated in the early stages of psoriatic arthritis, this could potentially modulate disease and therefore allow us to discontinue the TNF inhibitor after achieving remission. Objective. To investigate whether remission induced by tumour necrosis factor alpha inhibitor (TNFi) and methotrexate in patients with early psoriatic arthritis is sustained after withdrawal of TNFi. Methods. Open-label extension of a recently published double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial. Patients with psoriatic arthritis fulfilling the CASPAR criteria and with active disease at baseline (swollen and tender joint count ≥ 3) were randomized to either golimumab and methotrexate or matched placebo and methotrexate. Patients in Disease Activity Score (DAS) remission at week 22 continued in the open-label extension on methotrexate monotherapy. The primary end point was the percentage of patients in DAS-CRP remission (DAS < 1.6) at week 50. Results. Eight patients from the original placebo group and 18 patients from the original TNFi group continued in the extension phase. At week 50, 6 out of 8 (75%) patients from the original MTX (methotrexate) group versus 10 out of 18 (56%) patients from the original MTX+TNFi group were in DAS-CRP remission (p = 0.347). Considering the total study population, 6 out of 24 (25%) of the original MTX group versus 10 out of 26 (38.5%) of the original MTX+TNFi group were in DAS remission at week 50 (p = 0.308). Conclusions. Remission achieved by initial combination treatment with TNFi and methotrexate in early psoriatic arthritis is maintained on methotrexate monotherapy in approximately half of the patients.

480;17230058;Chemoreduction for intraocular retinoblastoma in Malaysia.;In the last decade, chemotherapy in combination with focal therapy (chemoreduction) has been increasingly used in intraocular retinoblastoma to avoid enucleation and radiotherapy. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility and outcome of chemoreduction in Malaysian children with retinoblastoma. This was a prospective study from August 2001 to January 2006. Twenty children (25 eyes) were given 4 cycles of chemoreduction, after which the response was assessed. Fourteen eyes showed a complete response, 10 eyes showed a partial response, and 1 eye had progressive disease. Twelve eyes developed progressive disease later, 9 after an initial complete response and 3 after a partial response. Overall, progressive disease occurred in 52%. There were 2 treatment failures, in Reese-Elsworth groups 3 and 4. Both eyes required enucleation. One eye in group 5 required second line chemotherapy to achieve a complete response. No eyes were irradiated. Five children (25%) defaulted follow-up, one of whom returned with disseminated disease. In conclusion, 4 cycles of chemoreduction achieved a durable complete response in only 12% of eyes. Chemoreduction is feasible in Malaysia but requires good patient compliance and close follow-up.;Visual system diseases;Interventional;Indication out-of-domain;Test

Methods Twenty-nine patients (29 eyes) with diabetes were enrolled in a double-masked, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical study. They were randomly assigned to one of two groups that received eyedrops containing either FGLM-amide and SSSR (n = 14) or phosphate-buffered saline (n = 15) four times a day for 14 days starting 1 day after phacoemulsification. SPK scores (area, density, and combined area and density) were determined before as well as 1, 3, 7, and 14 days after surgery as main outcome measures. Results SPK scores did not differ between the two groups before surgery or before initiation of treatment. At day 2 after treatment initiation, all SPK scores were significantly lower in the FGLM-amide/SSSR group than in the control group. The density score was also significantly lower in the former group at day 7 after surgery. All scores returned to preoperative levels by day 14 after surgery in both groups. Conclusions Eyedrops containing FGLM-amide and SSSR were effective for the prevention of SPK after cataract surgery in diabetic patients.;Visual system diseases;Interventional;Indication out-of-domain;Test

Design Monocenter randomized controlled clinical trial; randomization and allocation to trial group were carried out by a central computer system. Participants We studied 180 eyes of 180 patients with severe proliferative diabetic retinopathy, half with tractional retinal detachment not involving the macula (n = 90). Some were treated by pars plana vitrectomy (n = 90) and some by panretinal photocoagulation (n = 90). Methods Eyes were randomly divided into 2 groups. Group 1 was treated with pars plana vitrectomy, membrane and internal limited membrane peeling, panretinal photocoagulation, and focal or grid macular laser. Group 2 was treated with panretinal photocoagulation and focal or grid macular laser. Follow-up was at least 12 months. Results Mean preoperative visual acuities and ophthalmic fundus characteristics were compared across groups. A year postoperation, visual acuity (the primary endpoint) in group 1 improved in 30 eyes (33%); was unchanged in 22 eyes (25%); and decreased in 38 eyes (42%). In group 2, visual acuity improved in 32 eyes (35%); was unchanged in 42 eyes (47%); and decreased in 16 eyes (18%). The percentage of improvement in the 2 groups was not statistically significant (p = 0.75), whereas the stabilized (p = 0.002) and worsened eyes (p = 0.0003) in group 1 and group 2 were significantly different. Conclusion In cases of severe proliferative diabetic retinopathy, even with tractional retinal detachment not involving macula, it is best to defer vitrectomy unless definite progression that threatens the vascular center is documented.";Visual system diseases;Interventional;Indication out-of-domain;Test

To evaluate the efficacy of different dosing paradigms of PF-04523655 (PF) versus ranibizumab (comparator) in subjects with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Design. Multicenter, open-label, prospective, randomized, comparator-controlled exploratory study. Participants. A total of 151 patients with subfoveal choroidal neovascularization (CNV) secondary to neovascular AMD who were naive to AMD therapy. Methods. In this phase 2 study, patients were randomized to 1 of 5 treatment groups with equal ratio. All groups received ranibizumab 0.5 mg at baseline and (a) PF 1 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W) from week 4 to week 12; (b) PF 3 mg Q4W from week 4 to week 12; (c) PF 3 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W) from week 4 to week 12; (d) PF 1 mg + ranibizumab (combination) Q4W from baseline to week 12; and (e) ranibizumab Q4W to week 12. All study treatments were given as intravitreal injections. Main outcome measures. The primary end point was the mean change in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) from baseline at week 16; secondary end points included the percentage of patients gaining ≥ 10 and ≥ 15 letters in BCVA and mean change in retinal central subfield thickness, lesion thickness, and CNV area. Results. At week 16, the PF 1 mg + ranibizumab combination group achieved numerically greater improvement in mean BCVA from baseline (9.5 letters) than the ranibizumab group (6.8 letters). The difference was not statistically significant. The BCVA improvement in the PF monotherapy groups was less than in the ranibizumab group. Similar trends were observed in the percentage of patients who gained ≥ 10 and ≥ 15 letters. From baseline to week 16 (last observed carried forward), the combination and ranibizumab groups had similar mean reductions in central subfield retinal thickness and total CNV area, which were greater than in all PF monotherapy groups. There were no clinically meaningful differences in reduction of lesion thickness among treatment groups. Conclusions. In this early, underpowered study evaluating treatments for neovascular AMD, the combination of PF with ranibizumab led to an average gain in BCVA that was more than with ranibizumab monotherapy.

Patients were randomly divided into two groups: Treated with antioxidant supplement (Group A) and untreated control group (Group B). Each tablet, for oral administration, containing pycnogenol 50 mg, Vitamin E 30 mg and coenzyme Q10 20 mg. CMT and free oxygen radical test (FORT) were analyzed at baseline (T0), 3 (T1) and 6 (T2) months in both groups. Results In Group A, FORT levels and CMT were significantly reduced over time (P < 0.001 for both). In Group B, FORT levels were increased (P < 0.001) and CMT did not vary significantly (P = 0.81) over 3 time points. Conclusions This is the first study showing the reduction of ROS levels in patients with NPDR thanks to antioxidant therapy. Moreover, our findings have suggested also an influence on retinal thickness.;Visual system diseases;Interventional;Indication out-of-domain;Test
485;27475933;Long-term results and recurrence rates after spironolactone treatment in non-resolving central serous chorio-retinopathy (CSCR).;Purpose. To evaluate the long-term results of spironolactone in non-resolving central serous chorio-retinopathy (CSCR) and recurrence rates of CSCR. Methods. Interventional uncontrolled open-label prospective clinical trial of patients with non-resolving CSCR who were treated with spironolactone 50 mg daily (Spironolacton AL® 50 mg, ALIUD PHARMA) for up to 16 weeks. Follow-up visits were performed at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Retreatment criteria for recurrence were: gain in sub-retinal fluid (SRF) of more than 25 % plus/or increase of central retinal thickness (CRT) of more than 50 μm plus visual symptoms compared to last visit. Main outcome measures. 12-month efficacy of upload treatment with spironolactone. Secondary outcome measure was the recurrence rate at 6, 9, and 12 months. Results. Of the 21 study eyes treated, 71 % (n = 15) showed significant improvement or complete regression on OCT examination over 12 months. Nineteen percent of the patients (n = 4) showed a stable course from visit 1 to visit 12. The overall reduction of sub-retinal fluid from visit 1 (156 μm ± 131 SD) to visit 12 (53 μm ± 93 SD) was statistically significant (p = 0.003). The change of mean visual acuity (log MAR) from 0.25 (± 0.17 SD) at baseline to 0.17 (± 0.18 SD) at visit 12 was statistically significant, with p = 0.044. Conclusion. Our results confirm a positive effect of spironolactone in non-resolving CSCR in 71 % of cases. Evaluation of recurrence rates and retreatments showed good results in patients who responded to spironolactone primarily. A prospective randomized trial may provide better data about this non-invasive treatment.;Visual system diseases;Interventional;Indication out-of-domain;Test
486;28448655;Change in Diabetic Retinopathy Through 2 Years: Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Clinical Trial Comparing Aflibercept, Bevacizumab, and Ranibizumab.;"Importance Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapy for diabetic macular edema (DME) favorably affects diabetic retinopathy (DR) improvement and worsening. It is unknown whether these effects differ across anti-VEGF agents. Objective To compare changes in DR severity during aflibercept, bevacizumab, or ranibizumab treatment for DME. Design, setting, and participants Preplanned secondary analysis of data from a comparative effectiveness trial for center-involved DME was conducted in 650 participants receiving aflibercept, bevacizumab, or ranibizumab. Retinopathy improvement and worsening were determined during 2 years of treatment. Participants were randomized in 2012 through 2013, and the trial concluded on September 23, 2015. Interventions Random assignment to aflibercept, 2.0 mg; bevacizumab, 1.25 mg; ranibizumab, 0.3 mg, up to every 4 weeks through 2 years following a retreatment protocol. Main outcomes and measures Percentages with retinopathy improvement at 1 and 2 years and cumulative probabilities for retinopathy worsening through 2-year without adjustment for multiple outcomes. Results A total of 650 participants (495 [76.2%] nonproliferative DR [NPDR], 155 proliferative DR [PDR]) were analyzed; 302 (46.5%) were women and mean (SD) age was 61 (10) years; 425 (65.4%) were white. At 1 year, among 423 NPDR eyes, 44 of 141 (31.2%) treated with aflibercept, 29 of 131 (22.1%) with bevacizumab, and 57 of 151 (37.7%) with ranibizumab had improvement of DR severity (adjusted difference: 11.7%; 95% CI, 2.9% to 20.6%; P = .004 for aflibercept vs bevacizumab; 8.9%; 95% CI, 1.7% to 16.1%; P = .01 for ranibizumab vs bevacizumab; and 2.9%; 95% CI, -5.7% to 11.4%; P = .51 for aflibercept vs ranibizumab). At 2 years, 33 eyes (24.8%) in the aflibercept group, 25 eyes (22.1%) in the bevacizumab group, and 40 eyes (31.0%) in the ranibizumab group had DR improvement; no treatment group differences were identified. For 93 eyes with PDR at baseline, 1-year improvement rates were 75.9% for aflibercept, 31.4% for bevacizumab, and 55.2% for ranibizumab (adjusted difference: 50.4%; 95% CI, 26.8% to 74.0%; P < .001 for aflibercept vs bevacizumab; 20.4%; 95% CI, -3.1% to 44.0%; P = .09 for ranibizumab vs bevacizumab; and 30.0%; 95% CI, 4.4% to 55.6%; P = .02 for aflibercept vs ranibizumab). These rates and treatment group differences appeared to be maintained at 2 years. Despite the reduced numbers of injections in the second year, 66 (59.5%) of NPDR and 28 (70.0%) of PDR eyes that manifested improvement at 1 year maintained improvement at 2 years. Two-year cumulative rates for retinopathy worsening ranged from 7.1% to 10.2% and 17.2% to 26.4% among anti-VEGF groups for NPDR and PDR eyes, respectively. No statistically significant treatment differences were noted. Conclusions and relevance At 1 and 2 years, eyes with NPDR receiving anti-VEGF treatment for DME may experience improvement in DR severity. Less improvement was demonstrated with bevacizumab at 1 year than with aflibercept or ranibizumab. Aflibercept was associated with more improvement at 1 and 2 years in the smaller subgroup of participants with PDR at baseline. All 3 anti-VEGF treatments were associated with low rates of DR worsening. These data provide additional outcomes that might be considered when choosing an anti-VEGF agent to treat DME.";Visual system diseases;Interventional;Indication out-of-domain;Test
487;29480253;Comparative evaluation of rotational stability and visual outcome of toric intraocular lenses with and without a capsular tension ring.;Purpose. To evaluate the rotational stability of toric intraocular lens (IOL) when co-implanted with a capsular tension ring (CTR) as compared to that of a toric IOL without a CTR. Methods. This was a prospective randomized clinical trial performed in a tertiary care centre in India. Fifty adult human eyes with visually significant cataract and regular corneal astigmatism ≥1.5D divided into two groups of 25 eyes each, A and B by simple randomization. Eyes with corneal pathology, lens subluxation, and a specular endothelial cell count <2000/mm2 were excluded from the study. The eyes in both the groups underwent standard phacoemulsification and were implanted with a toric IOL. In Group A, a CTR was put in the bag before IOL implantation. The groups were called for follow-up on day 1, 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months, postoperatively. The axis of the toric IOL on each visit was measured by slit lamp imaging in retroillumination and analyzed digitally. Results. Mean rotation of toric IOL at 3 months postoperatively was 1.85 ± 1.72° in Group A and 4.02 ± 2.04° in Group B. The difference was statistically significant (P = 0.003). Conclusion. Coimplantation of a CTR is a safe and effective technique for ensuring better rotational stability of toric IOLs.;Visual system diseases;Interventional;Indication out-of-domain;Test
488;30237467;A randomized clinical trial evaluating choroidal blood flow and morphology after conventional and pattern scan laser panretinal photocoagulation.;We prospectively investigated the changes in choroidal blood flow and morphology after panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) in 39 eyes with severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (S-NPDR). Seventeen eyes underwent PRP by conventional laser and 22 eyes underwent pattern scan laser (PASCAL). The choroidal blood flow was assessed by laser speckle flowgraphy, and the subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT) was measured with optical coherence tomography before and 1, 4, 8, and 12 weeks after the two types of PRP treatments. The choroidal mean blur rate (MBR) at the macular region was significantly reduced to 86.4% of the baseline level in the conventional laser group and 85.7% in the PASCAL group at Week 12 (P = 0.001, P < 0.001, respectively). The SFCT was significantly increased at 1 week following PRP but it was significantly reduced at Week 8 (P = 0.001, P < 0.001, respectively) in both groups. The differences in the ratio of the MBR and the SFCT was not significant between the conventional laser and PASCAL groups at any time after PRP. The results suggest that appropriate PRP treatments even by the PASCAL method will reduce the choroidal blood flow and the choroidal morphological components.;Visual system diseases;Interventional;Indication out-of-domain;Test
489;31255587;A Randomized Clinical Trial of Immediate Versus Delayed Glasses for Moderate Hyperopia in Children 3 to 5 Years of Age.;"Purpose. To compare visual acuity (VA) and binocularity outcomes in moderately hyperopic children with normal VA and binocularity assigned to glasses versus observation. Design. Prospective randomized clinical trial (RCT). Methods. One hundred nineteen 3- to 5-year-old children with hyperopia between +3.00D and +6.00D spherical equivalent were randomly assigned to glasses versus observation (with glasses prescribed if deteriorated for subnormal distance VA or near stereoacuity, or manifest strabismus). Follow-up occurred every 6 months. At 3 years, the treatment strategy was classified as ""failed"" if any of the following were met, both with and without correction: subnormal distance VA or stereoacuity; manifest strabismus; or strabismus surgery during follow-up. Results. Of 84 (71%) children who completed the primary outcome examination, failure occurred in five (12%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 4%-26%) of 41 assigned to glasses and four (9%; 95% CI: 3%-22%) of 43 assigned to observation (difference = 3%; 95% CI: -12%-18%; P = .72). Deterioration prior to 3 years (requiring glasses per protocol) occurred in 29% (95% CI: 19%-43%) assigned to glasses and 27% (95% CI: 17%-42%) assigned to observation. Conclusions. In an RCT comparing glasses to observation for moderately hyperopic 3- to 5-year-old children with normal VA and binocularity, failure for VA or binocularity was not common. With insufficient enrollment and retention, our study was unable to determine whether immediate glasses prescription reduces failure rate, but low failure rates suggest that immediate glasses prescription for these children may not be needed to prevent failure for VA and/or binocularity.";Visual system diseases;Interventional;Indication out-of-domain;Test
490;17372330;Measures of adiposity and cardiovascular disease risk factors.;"Objective. To determine which of five measures of adiposity maintains the strongest association with cardiovascular disease risk factors. Research methods and procedures. A nationally representative sample of 12,608 adult participants of the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were examined. Waist circumference, total body fat, percent body fat, BMI, and skinfold thickness were measured following a standardized protocol. Results. In multivariable adjusted models including waist circumference and BMI as independent variables, waist circumference was a significantly better predictor. The odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) for each standard deviation higher waist circumference and BMI for men were as follows: 1.88 (1.43, 2.48) and 0.99 (0.76, 1.29), respectively, for hypertension; 1.51 (0.87, 2.59) and 1.23 (0.76, 1.99), respectively, for diabetes; and 1.85 (1.48, 2.32) and 1.00 (0.80, 1.24), respectively, for low high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol. The analogous odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) for women were as follows: 2.28 (1.74, 3.00) and 0.91 (0.69, 1.19), respectively, for hypertension; 2.72 (1.85, 4.00) and 0.82 (0.55, 1.23), respectively, for diabetes; and 1.90 (1.47, 2.47) and 1.07 (0.83, 1.38), respectively, for low high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol. Results were markedly similar for waist circumference in models adjusting for total body fat, percent body fat, and skinfold thickness separately. In contrast, waist circumference was not a significantly better predictor of elevated C-reactive protein than the other measures of adiposity. Discussion. Waist circumference maintains a stronger association with cardiovascular disease risk factors than other measures of adiposity.";Circulatory system diseases;Observational;Study type out-of-domain;Test
491;25200562;Ambulatory blood pressure adds little to Framingham Risk Score for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in older men: secondary analysis of observational study data.;"Objective. To determine the incremental value of ambulatory blood pressure (BP) in predicting cardiovascular risk when the Framingham Risk Score (FRS) is known. Methods. We included 780 men without cardiovascular disease from the Uppsala Longitudinal Study of Adult Men, all aged approximately 70 years at baseline. We first screened ambulatory systolic BP (ASBP) parameters for their incremental value by adding them to a model with 10-year FRS. For the best ASBP parameter we estimated HRs and changes in discrimination, calibration and reclassification. We also estimated the difference in the number of men started on treatment and in the number of men protected against a cardiovascular event. Results. Mean daytime ASBP had the highest incremental value; adding other parameters did not yield further improvements. While ASBP was an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, addition to FRS led to only small increases to the overall model fit, discrimination (a 1% increase in the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve), calibration and reclassification. We estimated that for every 10,000 men screened with ASBP, 141 fewer would start a new BP-lowering treatment (95% CI 62 to 220 less treated), but this would result in 7 fewer cardiovascular events prevented over the subsequent 10 years (95% CI 21 fewer events prevented to 7 more events prevented). Conclusions. In addition to a standard cardiovascular risk assessment it is not clear that ambulatory BP measurement provides further incremental value. The clinical role of ambulatory BP requires ongoing careful consideration.";Circulatory system diseases;Observational;Study type out-of-domain;Test
492;27291832;Cardiovascular and metabolic monitoring of children and adolescents on antipsychotic treatment: A cross-sectional descriptive study.;Background. Cardiovascular and metabolic monitoring of patients on antipsychotic medication is essential. This becomes more important in those of paediatric age, as they are more vulnerable, and also because prescriptions of this kind of drugs are still increasing. Aim. To evaluate the monitoring of cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors in a group of children and young people on antipsychotic medication. Method. A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in which a group of 220 patients aged 8-17 years, diagnosed with a mental disorder and on antipsychotic treatment. They were compared to a control group of 199 asthmatic patients not exposed to antipsychotic drugs. Data was extracted from the computerised clinical history ECAP in 2013. Results. The mean age of the children was 12 years (8-17). Risperidone (67%) was the most frequent treatment. The recording of Body Mass Index (BMI) and blood pressure (AP) was 50% in Mental Disorder (MD) patients. A higher number of cardiovascular monitoring physical parameters (weight, height, BMI and BP) were observed in the MD group compared to the control Asthma control group. Altogether, more physical parameters than biochemistry parameters were recorded. Conclusions. This study shows that the recording of cardiovascular parameters and metabolic studies needs to be improved in children and adolescents on treatment with antipsychotics.;Circulatory system diseases;Observational;Study type out-of-domain;Test

The outcome of acute ischaemic stroke due to tandem vertebrobasilar artery occlusion was poor. Endovascular revascularisation may be a positive approach for acute basilar artery occlusion combined with vertebral ostium stenosis or occlusion. We reported seven patients with acute vertebrobasilar tandem occlusion by using angioplasty or stenting for proximal lesion and thrombectomy for distal occlusion. Materials and methods. Consecutive patients with acute tandem vertebrobasilar artery occlusion at two centres were included in this study. We retrospectively analysed the clinical, technical and functional outcomes of the patients. Results. From March 2016 to March 2017, seven patients were included. The mean age and National Institute of Health Stroke Scale score at admission was 57 years and 22, respectively. A reverse approach was used in five patients. The Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction score 2b-3 was acquired in all patients. There were no procedural complications. The modified Rankin Scale score was 1-2 for three patients and 4 for one patient at 3 months. Three patients died at 3 months of follow-up. Conclusions.

This analysis included patients with a discharge diagnosis of NVAF in 2010 and 2014, which constituted the pre- and post-DOACs populations, respectively. Results. Approximately 90% of patients were eligible for oral anticoagulant (OAC) therapy. Overall use of OACs increased from 38% in 2010 to 45% in 2014; use of antiplatelet therapy decreased from 36 to 25%. Approximately 14% of eligible patients remained untreated. Conclusion. Although an improvement in OAC prescription was observed post-DOACs launch, treatment patterns in Italy suggest that a proportion of patients with NVAF are still undertreated or do not receive appropriate therapy.";Circulatory system diseases;Observational;Study type out-of-domain;Test
495;30713028;A Nested Case-Control Study on Plasma Vitamin E and Risk of Cancer: Evidence of Effect Modification by Selenium.;Background. Evidence from epidemiologic studies has been inconsistent regarding the role of vitamin E in cancer incidence risk. Objective. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prospective association between baseline plasma vitamin E levels and subsequent cancer risk in Chinese adults with hypertension, and to identify effect modifiers. Design. A nested, case-control study was conducted from 20,702 hypertensive participants in the China Stroke Primary Prevention Trial, a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial, conducted from May 2008 to August 2013. Participants. The current study included 229 new cancer cases and 229 controls matched for age (±1 year), sex, treatment group, and study site. Main outcome measures. Plasma vitamin E was measured by liquid chromatography with tandem quadrupole mass spectrometers and plasma selenium was measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry using Thermo Fisher iCAP Q ICP-MS. Statistical analyses. Odds ratios (OR) of cancer in relation to plasma concentrations of vitamin E were calculated using conditional logistic regression models. Results. Median follow-up duration was 4.5 years. Overall, vitamin E was not associated with subsequent risk of total cancer (per 1-mg/L [2.3 μmol/L] increase: OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.09) and non-gastrointestinal cancer (OR 1.10, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.24). However, there was a significant, inverse association between vitamin E and gastrointestinal cancer (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.99), particularly esophageal cancer (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.95). Moreover, high vitamin E decreased the risk of total cancer (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.84 to 0.99) and gastrointestinal cancer (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.95) among patients with high selenium levels (median≥83.7 μg/L [1.1 μmol/L]), and increased the risk of total cancer (OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.26) and non-gastrointestinal cancer (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.50) among those with low selenium levels (<83.7 μg/L [1.1 μmol/L]). Conclusions. This study suggests that higher levels of plasma vitamin E are associated with reduced risk of gastrointestinal cancer. High vitamin E decreased the risk of total cancer among patients with high selenium levels, but increased the risk of total cancer among those with low selenium levels.;Circulatory system diseases;Observational;Study type out-of-domain;Test
496;32320043;Off-label Use of Direct Oral Anticoagulants Compared With Warfarin for Left Ventricular Thrombi.;"Importance. Left ventricular (LV) thrombi can arise in patients with ischemic and nonischemic cardiomyopathies. Anticoagulation is thought to reduce the risk of stroke or systemic embolism (SSE), but there are no high-quality data on the effectiveness of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) for this indication. Objective. To compare the outcomes associated with DOAC use and warfarin use for the treatment of LV thrombi. Design, setting, and participants. A cohort study was performed at 3 tertiary care academic medical centers among 514 eligible patients with echocardiographically diagnosed LV thrombi between October 1, 2013, and March 31, 2019. Follow-up was performed through the end of the study period. Exposures. Type and duration of anticoagulant use. Main outcomes and measures. Clinically apparent SSE. Results. A total of 514 patients (379 men; mean [SD] age, 58.4 [14.8] years) with LV thrombi were identified, including 300 who received warfarin and 185 who received a DOAC (64 patients switched treatment between these groups). The median follow-up across the patient cohort was 351 days (interquartile range, 51-866 days). On unadjusted analysis, DOAC treatment vs warfarin use (hazard ratio [HR], 2.71; 95% CI, 1.31-5.57; P = .01) and prior SSE (HR, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.22-3.72; P = .01) were associated with SSE. On multivariable analysis, anticoagulation with DOAC vs warfarin (HR, 2.64; 95% CI, 1.28-5.43; P = .01) and prior SSE (HR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.17-3.66; P = .01) remained significantly associated with SSE. Conclusions and relevance. In this multicenter cohort study of anticoagulation strategies for LV thrombi, DOAC treatment was associated with a higher risk of SSE compared with warfarin use, even after adjustment for other factors. These results challenge the assumption of DOAC equivalence with warfarin for LV thrombi and highlight the need for prospective randomized clinical trials to determine the most effective treatment strategies for LV thrombi.";Circulatory system diseases;Observational;Study type out-of-domain;Test
497;32565089;Association Between β-Blockers and Outcome of Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting: Before and After 1 Year.;"Background. We evaluated the long-term outcomes of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) according to β-blocker therapy using landmark analysis. Although β-blockers have been shown to improve outcomes for ischemic heart disease, the long-term effects and optimal treatment duration of use after CABG remain unknown. Methods. From January 2001 to December 2014, 5382 CABG patients were stratified into 2 groups according to β-blocker therapy at discharge (β-blocker group: 3677 [68.3%], no β-blocker group: 1705 [31.7%]). Results. The primary outcome was all-cause death during 48 months of follow-up. Using propensity score-matched analysis, β-blocker therapy was associated with all-cause death during the 48-month follow-up (hazard ratio [HR], 0.62; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.41-0.95; P = .03). The landmark analysis demonstrated that the effect of β-blockers on all-cause death was particularly significant within the first 12 months of therapy (HR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.19-0.80; P = .01) but not after 12 months (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.56-1.53; P = .77). Conclusions. The benefits of postdischarge β-blockers may be limited to 1 year after CABG, but further studies are required to confirm this finding.";Circulatory system diseases;Observational;Study type out-of-domain;Test
498;7946104;Cross-sectional study of the susceptibility of Candida isolates to antifungal drugs and in vitro-in vivo correlation in HIV-infected patients.;"Objectives. To investigate (1) the frequency of clinical resistance to oral polyenes or azole treatment for oral candidiasis, (2) the frequency of resistant in vitro Candida strains, (3) the relationship between the susceptibilities of in vitro Candida species and in vivo status in HIV patients. Design. Prospective cross-sectional study. Setting. Tertiary care clinic at Bocage Hospital, Dijon, France. Patients. HIV-infected patients with and without oral candidiasis. Interventions. Clinical examination, oral swab for mycologic investigations. Main outcome measures. Clinical diagnosis of oral candidiasis, identification of the antifungal treatment given within the previous month, identification of Candida species, antimycogramm and determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) for fluconazole, and measurement of T-helper cell count. Results. Within a 2-month period, 154 HIV-infected patients were studied: 46 heterosexuals, 51 intravenous drug users (IVDU), 52 homosexuals and five blood transfusion recipients. The percentages of patients with oral candidiasis were: 41, 80, 44 and 20%, respectively (P < 0.05); the mean T-helper cell counts were 200, 135, 210 and 238 x 10(6)/l cells, respectively (P < 0.05). Twenty-two patients (14.3%) had received recent azole treatment and 29 (18.8%) recent oral polyene treatment. Among the 84 patients with and the 70 patients without oral candidiasis, 78 and 28 Candida strains were isolated, respectively. Although Candida albicans represented the majority of Candida species (88 strains, 83%), the non-albicans strains were isolated more frequently in patients who had received recent antifungal treatment. No strains were resistant to ketoconazole, miconazole or econazole; however, six (5.6%), 16 (15%) and 10 (9.5%) were intermediately susceptible to the three drugs, respectively. Twelve (13.6%) of the 88 C. albicans, five of the six C. (Torulopsis) glabrata, one of the five C. tropicalis and all three C. krusei strains were resistant to fluconazole. These resistant strains were separated as follows: 41.1% of C. albicans strains resistant to fluconazole were isolated from patients who had received recent azole therapy, 17.6% from patients who received recent oral polyene, and 3.7% from patients who had not received any recent antifungal treatment (P = 0.004). The mean MIC of these three categories of isolates were 3.6, 1.6 and 0.6 mg/l, respectively (P = 0.06). Conclusions. Oral candidiasis and fluconazole-resistant Candida isolates are more frequently found in IVDU. Treatments using azoles select non-albicans strains and are associated with decreased susceptibilities of C. albicans strains to fluconazole in particular. These findings show that prolonged azole treatment in severely immunocompromised patients should be avoided.";Endocrine, nutritional or metabolic diseases;Observational;Study type out-of-domain;Test
499;28529199;Can Fetuin-A Be a Marker for Insulin Resistance and Poor Glycemic Control in Children with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus?;"Objective. Metabolic impairment in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) with poor glycemic control causes insulin resistance, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), atherosclerosis, and increased carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT). Fetuin-A has a protective effect in cardiovascular disorders and is increased in hepatosteatosis. We aimed to investigate the reliability of fetuin-A levels in early detection of diabetic complications in children with T1DM and to identify a cut-off value that may show poor metabolic control. Methods. The study included 80 patients who had T1DM for at least 5 years and who had no chronic complications or an auto-immune disorder. Blood samples were drawn to measure hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), biochemical parameters, and fetuin-A levels. Anthropometric parameters were also measured. Percent body fat was calculated. Hepatosteatosis and CIMT were assessed by sonography. Results. Mean age of the patients was 13.5 years. Grade 1 hepatosteatosis was detected in 10%. Patients were stratified into 2 groups based on presence of NAFLD. Fetuin-A level was increased in patients with NAFLD. We identified a fetuin-A cut-off value (514.28 ng/mL; sensitivity: 47.34; specificity: 96.72) that may predict NAFLD. HbA1c and total cholesterol levels were found to be higher in patients with fetuin-A levels above higher the cut-off value. Conclusion.

Methods This is a secondary analysis of the 5-year follow-up of the RADIEL GDM prevention study including 333 women at high GDM risk (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m and/or previous GDM). Five years postpartum metabolic health was assessed including anthropometric measurements, oral glucose tolerance test, lipid metabolism, and body composition as well as medical history questionnaires. For the analysis, we divided the women into four groups based on parity, BMI, and previous history of GDM. Results Five years postpartum impaired glucose regulation (IFG, IGT, or diabetes) was diagnosed in 15% of the women; 3.6% had type 2 diabetes. The highest prevalence was observed among obese women with a history of GDM (26%), and the lowest prevalence (8%) among primiparous obese women (p = 0.021). At follow-up 25-39% of the obese women fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for the metabolic syndrome, in the non-obese group 11% (p < 0.001). This was associated with body fat percentage. The non-obese group, however, faced metabolic disturbances (IFG, IGT, diabetes, or metabolic syndrome) at a significantly lower BMI (p < 0.001). Among women who were non-obese before pregnancy, 5 years postpartum, the obesity prevalence based on BMI was 14% and based on body fat percentage 58%. Conclusions The prevalence of impaired glucose regulation and metabolic syndrome is high 5 years postpartum among women at high risk of GDM. There are high-risk women also among the non-obese, who develop metabolic derangements already at a lower BMI.

501;30278576;Association between polycystic ovarian syndrome and endometrial, ovarian, and breast cancer: A population-based cohort study in Taiwan.;Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder among the women of reproductive age. We conducted a nationwide population-based retrospective cohort study to analyze the association between PCOS and the subsequent development of gynecological cancers, namely endometrial, breast, and ovarian cancer.For this population-based cohort study, we used the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, which contains information on approximately 24.7 million insured individuals. The cohort included women who had received a diagnosis of PCOS between 1998 and 2013. An age-matched systematic random-sampling method with a ratio of 1:4 was used for patient selection for the non-PCOS reference cohort. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used to determine the effects of PCOS on the risks of gynecologic and breast cancer. The data are presented as hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).The PCOS cohort consisted of 8155 patients with PCOS, and the comparison cohort consisted of 32,620 matched patients without PCOS. The incidence of endometrial cancer was 226 and 15 per 100,000 person-years in the PCOS and comparison groups, respectively. A statistically significant higher risk of endometrial cancer was found in the PCOS cohort (adjusted HR [aHR] = 17.7, 95% CI = 4.9-64.2) than in the comparison cohort. However, no association was observed between PCOS and ovarian (aHR = 1.64, 95% CI: 0.63-4.27) or breast cancer (aHR = 0.98, 95% CI: 0.58-1.65).The results of this large population-based cohort study supported the premise that women with PCOS might have an increased risk of endometrial cancer, but no association between PCOS and the risks of ovarian and breast cancer was found.;Endocrine, nutritional or metabolic diseases;Observational;Study type out-of-domain;Test
502;30620236;The Relationship Between Cardiorespiratory Fitness and Arterial Stiffness in Middle-Aged Men with Abdominal Obesity.;Background. Abdominal obesity increases rapidly after middle age in Korean men, and there is an associated trend toward increasing levels of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) on arterial stiffness in men with abdominal obesity. Methods. A total of 387 middle-aged men (ages 42-59 years) with abdominal obesity participated in this cross-sectional study. Abdominal obesity was defined as a waist circumference ≥90 cm. Arterial stiffness was derived from brachial/ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV). A treadmill exercise test was conducted to directly assess CRF using the peak oxygen uptake. Blood glucose, blood pressure, lipids, C-related protein (CRP), and baPWV were measured at rest. Results. CRF was inversely associated with baPWV (r = -0.340, P = 0.014) and CRP level (r = -0.325, P = 0.026). In addition, high CRF was associated with a lower triglyceride level (r = -0.219, P = 0.030) and a higher high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level (r = 0.317, P = 0.019). Conclusions. These results demonstrated that high CRF was inversely associated with arterial stiffness in men with abdominal obesity. These results suggest that maintaining a high level of CRF can help middle-aged men with abdominal obesity to improve blood factors related to CVD.;Endocrine, nutritional or metabolic diseases;Observational;Study type out-of-domain;Test

To identify demographic risk factors associated with high stress and examine the relationships between levels of stress, demographics and dietary fat, fruit and vegetable intakes in low-income pregnant women with overweight or obesity. Design. A cross-sectional study. Setting. Participants were recruited from the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children in Michigan, USA.ParticipantsParticipants (n 353) were non-Hispanic Black (black) or White (white). Results. Women aged 35 years or older (OR=4·09; 95% CI 1·45, 11·51) and who had high school or less education (OR=1·88; 95% CI 1·22, 2·89) or were unemployed (OR=1·89; 95% CI 1·15, 3·12) were significantly more likely to report high stress than women who were younger, had at least some college education or were employed/homemakers. However, race and smoking status were not associated with level of stress. Women with high stress reported significantly lower fruit and vegetable intakes but not fat intake than women with low stress. Women aged 35 years or older reported significantly higher vegetable but not fat or fruit intake than women who were 18-24 years old. Black women reported significantly higher fat but not fruit or vegetable intake than white women. Education, employment and smoking status were not significantly associated with dietary intake of fat, fruits and vegetables. Conclusions. Nutrition counselling on reducing fat and increasing fruit and vegetable intakes may consider targeting women who are black or younger or who report high stress, respectively.";Endocrine, nutritional or metabolic diseases;Observational;Study type out-of-domain;Test
504;30664006;Metabolic syndrome and endocrine status in HIV-infected transwomen.;Background. HIV-infected transwomen face multiple specific issues. Economic and social marginalization, sex work, substance abuse, hormonal consumption and silicone injection may affect the course of HIV infection and lead to metabolic and endocrine complications. Methods. A matched case-control study was performed between 2013 and 2015 in a University Hospital and compared metabolic syndrome (MetS), thyroid and adrenal functions in HIV-infected transwomen (i.e. cases) and cisgender HIV-infected men (i.e. controls) matched for age and antiretroviral therapy. The interaction between hormonal consumption, the course of HIV infection and antiretroviral therapy was also studied. Clinical and biological data (CD4 cell count, HIV RNA load, antiretroviral plasma drug concentration, HDL, triglycerides, glucose, cortisol, thyroid stimulating hormone, free thyroxine, prolactine) were measured. Results. A total of 292 HIV-infected patients (100 cases and 192 controls) were prospectively included. There was no difference between the two populations in terms of frequency of MetS, but subclinical hypothyroidism and adrenal insufficiency were more frequent in cases than in controls with, respectively, 12 vs. 3% (P < 0.002) for hypothyroidism and 20 vs. 8% (P < 0.001) for adrenal insufficiency. Prolactinemia, only performed in transwomen, was often elevated (21%) but rarely confirmed as true active hyperprolactinemia (monomeric form) (3%). Although hormonal intake was frequent among transwomen (31%), no impact on antiretroviral bioavailability and efficacy was detected. Conclusion. In this study, no increase in the prevalence of MetS was detected in HIV-infected transwomen patients. In contrast, adrenal and thyroid functions abnormalities were frequent and should be systematically assessed in this population. No impact of hormonal intake on antiretroviral bioavailability and efficacy was detected.;Endocrine, nutritional or metabolic diseases;Observational;Study type out-of-domain;Test
505;22024091;Predictive value of serum CEA, CA19-9 and CA72.4 in early diagnosis of recurrence after radical resection of gastric cancer.;"Background/aims. To explore the predictive value of markers in detection of recurrence after resection. Methodology. This study was a case-control retrospective analysis; 521 patients underwent radical gastrectomy from April 2000 to January 2008, among whom 142 cases with complete data were involved. Seventy one were confirmed with recurrence, while the other 71 without recurrence were randomly selected from the database as control. We analyzed the popular serum marker change patterns and their correlation with imaging. Results. The two groups were well balanced in characteristics. Among the 3 markers, CA72.4 appeared highest in sensitivity (35.2%) while CEA had the lowest sensitivity. The sensitivity of triple-marker was 62.0%. We found that CEA, CA19-9 and CA72.4 elevated 2-4 months before imaging demonstration. If the cut-off values of CEA and CA19-9 were set twice as the upper limit of the normal, the specificities will increase to 98.6% and 94.4%, respectively. The sensitivity of single marker (CEA or CA 2.4) was 33.3% in predicting peritoneal metastasis, triple-marker had the highest sensitivity (66.7%). Conclusions. The combined of CEA, CA19-9 and CA72.4 had 62.0% sensitivity in the diagnosis of recurrence after radical surgery.

506;23082771;ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma presenting as intradural spinal mass: first reported case and review of literature.;"Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) is characterized by large anaplastic cells of T-cell or null-cell phenotype expressing CD30 (Ki-1 antigen). In most cases this neoplasm expresses the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), a chimeric protein resulting from the t(2;5)(p23;q35) translocation. ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma is most frequent in the first three decades of life and shows a male predominance, involving both nodal and extranodal sites, but rarely the CNS. We report a 21-year-old patient with a previous history of nodal ALK-positive ALCL, lymphohistiocytic subtype, who was admitted for recent occurrence of left-sided anesthesia with pain and progressive motor weakness of both legs. An MRI of the spine documented an intradural extramedullary mass dislocating the thoracic cord, suggesting a meningioma and the patient underwent surgical decompression. Histological examination revealed a lymphoproliferative neoplasm with morphology and immunophenotype of ALK-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma. After surgery, all preoperative symptoms disappeared.

507;23234464;Statins and the risk of gastric cancer in diabetes patients.;"Background. Several studies have suggested a cancer risk reduction in statin users although the evidence remains weak for stomach cancer. The purpose of this study was to use an exact-matching case-control design to examine the risk of gastric cancer associated with the use of statins in a cohort of patients with diabetes. Methods. Cases were defined as patients with incident gastric cancer identified by International Classification of Diseases 16.0 ~ 16.9 recorded at Samsung Medical Center database during the period of 1999 to 2008, at least 6 months after the entry date of diabetes code. Each gastric cancer case patient was matched with one control patient from the diabetes patient registry in a 1:1 fashion, blinded to patient outcomes. Results. A total of 983 cases with gastric cancer and 983 controls without gastric cancer, matched by age and sex, were included in the analysis. The presence of prescription for any statin was inversely associated with gastric cancer risk in the unadjusted conditional logistic regression model (OR: 0.18; 95% CI: 0.14 - 0.24; P < .0001). Multivariate analysis using conditional logistic regression with Bonferroni's correction against aspirin indicated a significant reduction in the risk of gastric cancer in diabetes patients with statin prescriptions (OR: 0.21; 95% CI: 0.16 - 0.28; P < .0001). After adjustment for aspirin use, a longer duration of statin use was associated with reduced risk of gastric cancer, with statistical significance (P<.0001). Conclusions. A strong inverse association was found between the risk of gastric adenocarcinoma and statin use in diabetic patients.";Neoplasms;Observational;Study type out-of-domain;Test
508;23863824;Use of disulfiram and risk of cancer: a population-based case-control study.;"Experimental studies have indicated that disulfiram (Antabuse) has antineoplastic effects against melanoma, breast, and prostate cancer. To explore this hypothesis, we examined the association between disulfiram use and these cancers in a nationwide register-based case-control study nested within ever-users (≥one prescription) of disulfiram. Cases were all Danish individuals with a histologically verified first-time diagnosis of malignant melanoma, breast, or prostate cancer during 2000-2009. For each case, we selected four cancer-free controls matched for age, sex, and year of first disulfiram prescription using risk set sampling. Similarly, for secondary analyses, we selected case-control populations for selected tobacco-related and alcohol-related cancer types, that is, cancers of the buccal cavity, liver, lung, and colorectal cancer. Disulfiram use 1 year before cancer diagnosis and the corresponding date for controls were disregarded. We estimated crude and adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for cancer associated with long-term (≥500 daily defined doses) versus one-time (one prescription) use of disulfiram. Among 53 856 disulfiram users, we identified 166, 644, and 464 cases, respectively, of melanoma, breast, or prostate cancer. Adjusted odds ratios for melanoma, breast, or prostate cancer associated with long-term disulfiram use were 1.04 (95% CI: 0.60-1.78), 0.92 (95% CI: 0.70-1.22), and 0.77 (95% CI: 0.56-1.06), respectively. For prostate cancer, dose-response analyses showed a further risk reduction with the highest cumulative dose level of disulfiram; however, the test for trend did not reach statistical significance. Our study provides some epidemiological support for a protective effect of disulfiram against prostate and breast cancer.";Neoplasms;Observational;Study type out-of-domain;Test
509;26749457;Predictive factors of occult neck metastasis in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma.;Introduction. It is well established that cervical lymph node metastasis is the most important prognostic factor in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract. The definition of parameters and classifications that could separate patients in groups of low, intermediate and high-risk is being attempted for several years. Objective. The objective of this study was to determine possible predictive factors related to the occurrence of occult cervical lymph node metastasis through the analysis of histopathological reports of surgical specimens obtained after oral squamous cell carcinoma resection and selective neck dissections of patients initially classified as N0. Methods. This was a primary, retrospective, observational, case-control study. Histopathological reports were reviewed to determine if some findings were related to the occurrence of occult lymph node metastasis. The events analyzed were oral cavity subsites, pT-stage, muscular infiltration, desmoplasia, vascular emboli, perineural infiltration, tumor thickness and compromised margins. Results. Occult cervical metastasis accounted for 19.10 percent of the cases. Desmoplasia, perineural infiltration, tumor thickness and pT4a stage are predictive factors of occult neck metastasis (p-value=0.0488, 0.0326, 0.0395, 0.0488, respectively). Conclusion. The accurate definition of predictive factors of occult cervical metastasis may guide the selection of patients that should be referred to radiotherapy, avoiding the unnecessary exposure of low-risk patients to radiation and allowing a better regional control of the disease in those of moderate or high risk.;Neoplasms;Observational;Study type out-of-domain;Test
510;27106231;Safety and efficacy of sorafenib in Japanese patients with hepatocellular carcinoma in clinical practice: a subgroup analysis of GIDEON.;Background. GIDEON was a prospective, global, non-interventional study evaluating the safety of sorafenib in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma in real-world practice. The aim of this subgroup analysis was to assess the safety and efficacy of sorafenib as used by Japanese patients. Methods. In Japan, 508 patients were valid for safety analysis. Efficacy and safety were evaluated by the Child-Pugh score. Results. The number of patients with Child-Pugh A and B was 432 (85.0 %) and 58 (11.4 %), respectively. The median overall survival time and time to progression in patients with Child-Pugh A and Child-Pugh B were 17.4 and 4.9 months, 3.7 and 2.3 months, respectively. The most common drug-related adverse events (AEs) included hand-foot skin reaction (47.8 %), diarrhea (35.8 %) and hypertension (24.2 %). The incidences of all or drug-related AEs were similar between patients with Child-Pugh A and B. However, all or drug-related serious AEs, AEs resulting in permanent discontinuation of sorafenib and deaths were observed more frequently in patients with Child-Pugh B compared with Child-Pugh A. Duration of treatment tended to be shorter as the Child-Pugh score worsened. Conclusions. Sorafenib was well tolerated by Japanese HCC patients in clinical settings. Patients with Child-Pugh B had shorter duration of treatment and higher incidence of SAEs. It is important to carefully evaluate patients' conditions and assess the benefit and risk before making a decision to treat patients with sorafenib.;Neoplasms;Observational;Study type out-of-domain;Test
511;30348604;Biomarker panel predicts survival after resection in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma: A multi-institutional cohort study.;"Background. Up to 60% of patients who undergo curative-intent pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) resection experience disease recurrence within six months. We recently published a systematic review of prognostic immunohistochemical biomarkers in PDAC and shortlisted a panel of those reported with the highest level of evidence, including p53, p16, Ca-125, S100A4, FOXC1, EGFR, mesothelin, CD24 and UPAR. This study aims to discover and validate the prognostic significance of a combinatorial panel of tumor biomarkers in patients with resected PDAC. Methods. Patients who underwent PDAC resection were included from a single institution discovery cohort and a multi-institutional validation cohort. Tumors in the discovery cohort were stained immunohistochemically for all nine shortlisted biomarkers. Biomarkers significantly associated with overall survival (OS) were reevaluated as a combinatorial panel in both discovery and validation cohorts for its prognostic significance. Results. 224 and 191 patients were included in the discovery and validation cohorts, respectively. In both cohorts, S100A4, Ca-125 and mesothelin expression were associated with shorter OS. In both cohorts, the number of these biomarkers expressed was significantly associated with OS (discovery cohort 36.8 vs. 26.4 vs 16.3 vs 12.8 months, P < 0.001; validation cohort 25.2 vs 18.3 vs 13.6 vs 11.9 months, P = 0.008 for expression of zero, one, two and three biomarkers, respectively). On multivariable analysis, expression of at least one of three biomarkers was independently associated with shorter OS. Conclusion. Combinations of S100A4, Ca-125 and mesothelin expression stratify survival after resection of localized PDAC. Co-expression of all three biomarkers is associated with the poorest prognostic outcome.";Neoplasms;Observational;Study type out-of-domain;Test

A computed tomography scan is an easy modality to estimate the skeletal muscle mass through cross-sectional image analysis at the level of the third lumbar vertebra (L3). Baseline skeletal muscle mass (SMM) was evaluated using gender-specific cutoffs for skeletal muscle index in NSCLC patients administered immunotherapy with nivolumab to evaluate its possible correlations with clinical outcomes. From April 2015 to August 2018, 23 stage IV NSCLC patients were eligible for image analysis. Nine patients (39.1%) had low SMM. Among patients with baseline low and non-low SMM, median progression free survival was 3.1 and 3.8 months, respectively (P = 0.0560), while median overall survival was 4.1 and 13 months, respectively (P = 0.2866). This hypothesis-generating preliminary report offers the opportunity to speculate about the negative influence of sarcopenia on immune response. In our opinion, nutritional status could affect the clinical outcomes of immunotherapy, even if we cannot make definitive conclusions here.

513;30633662;Parental coping with retinoblastoma diagnosis.;Objective. To characterize coping and distress among parents of children with retinoblastoma, and to uncover their association with perceived health literacy, self-efficacy, and social support. Methods. This was a cross-sectional study performed in the retinoblastoma clinics of Beijing Children's Hospital, Jilin Eye Hospital and Changchun Hospital in China. Parents of children with retinoblastoma (n = 104) completed a print Mandarin language questionnaire consisting of four sections: (i) demographic information, (ii) mini-mental adjustment to cancer scale, (iii) hospital anxiety and depression scale, and (iv) perceived health literacy, self-efficacy, and social support scales. Scores were tabulated for each measure and analyzed by bivariate correlation. Results. Moderate anxiety affected 59.2% of parents, and 77.7% experienced low, moderate, or high levels of depression. Combined anxiety and depression was positively correlated with helplessness/hopelessness (R = 0.42, p < .01) and anxious preoccupation (R = 0.247, p < .05), and negatively correlated with perceived self-efficacy (R = -0.228, p < .05). Perceived social support from a partner was negatively correlated with depression (R = -0.207, p < .05) and helplessness/hopelessness (R = -0.271, p < .01). Conclusions.

514;32546271;Establishment of a serological molecular model for the early diagnosis and progression monitoring of bone metastasis in lung cancer;"Background: The prognosis is very poor for lung cancer patients with bone metastasis. Unfortunately, a suitable method has yet to become available for the early diagnosis of bone metastasis in lung cancer patients. The present work describes an attempt to develop a novel model for the early identification of lung cancer patients with bone metastasis risk. Methods: As the test group, 205 primary lung cancer patients were recruited, of which 127 patients had bone metastasis; the other 78 patients without bone metastasis were set as the negative control. Additionally, 106 healthy volunteers were enrolled as the normal control. Serum levels of several cytokines in the bone microenvironment (CaN, OPG, PTHrP, and IL-6) and bone turnover markers (tP1NP, β-CTx) were detected in all samples by ECLIA or ELISA assay. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate diagnostic abilities and to assess the attributable risk of bone metastasis for each of these indicators; the diagnostic model was established via logistic regression analysis. The prospective validation group consisted of 44 patients with stage IV primary lung cancer on whom a follow-up of at least 2 years was conducted, during which serum bone biochemical marker concentrations were monitored.Results: The serological molecular model for the diagnosis of bone metastasis was logit (p). ROC analysis showed that when logit (p) > 0.452, the area under curve of the model was 0.939 (sensitivity: 85.8%, specificity: 89.7%). Model validation demonstrated accuracy with a high degree of consistency (specificity: 85.7%, specificity: 87.5%, Kappa: 0.770). The average predictive time for bone metastasis occurrence of the model was 9.46 months earlier than that of the bone scan diagnosis. Serum OPG, PTHrP, tP1NP, β-CTx, and the diagnostic model logit (p) were all positively correlated with bone metastasis progression (P < 0.05). Conclusions: This diagnostic model has the potential to be a simple, non-invasive, and sensitive tool for diagnosing the occurrence and monitoring the progression of bone metastasis in patients with lung cancer.

To examine pulmonary function, exercise capacity, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) survivors. Methods. We evaluated survivors with confirmed SARS at the Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong, at 3, 6, and 12 months after symptom onset. Our assessment included: lung volume (total lung capacity [TLC], vital capacity, residual volume, functional residual capacity), spirometry (FVC, FEV1), diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (D(LCO)), inspiratory and expiratory respiratory muscle strength, 6-min walk distance (6MWD), chest radiographs (CXRs), and HRQoL by Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form General Health Survey questionnaire. Results. Ninety-seven patients completed the serial assessments. There were 39 male and 58 female patients, and 63 patients (70%) were health-care workers (mean age, 36.9 years [SD, 9.5 years]; body mass index, 23.7 kg/m2 [SD, 4.0 kg/m2]). At 1 year, 27 patients (27.8%) had abnormal CXR findings. Four patients (4.1%), 5 patients (5.2%), and 23 patients (23.7%) had FVC, TLC, and D(LCO) values < 80% of predicted values, respectively. The 6MWD at 12 months was 511.0 m (SD, 89.8 m), which was higher than at 3 months (mean difference, 47.0 m; 95% confidence interval [CI], 31.8 to 62.1 m; p < 0.01) but not different from 6 months (mean difference, 9.7 m; 95% CI, - 4.4 to 23.8 m; p = 0.18). The 6MWD was lower than that for normal control subjects of the same age groups, and there was impairment of HRQoL at 12 months. Patients who required ICU admission (n = 31) showed higher CXR scores (1.6 [SD, 3.1]; vs 0.4 [SD, 1.1]; p = 0.04) and lower percentage of predicted FVC, TLC, and Dlco than those who did not, but there were no differences in 6MWD and health status. Conclusion. Significant impairment in Dlco was noted in 23.7% of survivors 1 year after illness onset. Exercise capacity and health status of SARS survivors were remarkably lower than those of a normal population.";Respiratory system diseases;Observational;Study type out-of-domain;Test
516;26352116;Hospital Incidence and Outcomes of the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Using the Kigali Modification of the Berlin Definition.;"Rationale. Estimates of the incidence of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in high- and middle-income countries vary from 10.1 to 86.2 per 100,000 person-years in the general population. The epidemiology of ARDS has not been reported for a low-income country at the level of the population, hospital, or intensive care unit (ICU). The Berlin definition may not allow identification of ARDS in resource-constrained settings.

Objectives. To estimate the incidence and outcomes of ARDS at a Rwandan referral hospital using the Kigali modification of the Berlin definition: without requirement for positive end-expiratory pressure, hypoxia cutoff of SpO2/FiO2 less than or equal to 315, and bilateral opacities on lung ultrasound or chest radiograph.

Methods. We screened every adult patient for hypoxia at a public referral hospital in Rwanda for 6 weeks. For every patient with hypoxia, we collected data on demographics and ARDS risk factors, performed lung ultrasonography, and evaluated chest radiography when available.

Measurements and main results. Forty-two (4.0%) of 1,046 hospital admissions met criteria for ARDS. Using various prespecified cutoffs for the SpO2/FiO2 ratio resulted in almost identical hospital incidence values. Median age for patients with ARDS was 37 years, and infection was the most common risk factor (44.1%). Only 30.9% of patients with ARDS were admitted to an ICU, and hospital mortality was 50.0%. Using traditional Berlin criteria, no patients would have met criteria for ARDS.

Conclusions. ARDS seems to be a common and fatal syndrome in a hospital in Rwanda, with few patients admitted to an ICU. The Berlin definition is likely to underestimate the impact of ARDS in low-income countries, where resources to meet the definition requirements are lacking. Although the Kigali modification requires validation before widespread use, we hope this study stimulates further work in refining an ARDS definition that can be consistently used in all settings.

518;29968887;Association between asthma control and Interleukin-17F expression levels in adult patients with atopic asthma.;"Objectives. To investigate the correlation between Interleukin 17 (IL-17F) and the level of asthma control. Methods. This is a cross-sectional study of 40 subjects who were diagnosed with atopic asthma. All participants were recruited from the Allergy and Immunology Clinic, Prof. R.D. Kandou General Hospital, Manado, Indonesia, between April 2015 and April 2016. Total serum IL-17F measured by using Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay methods; and mRNA IL-17F was obtained by using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Level of asthma control was quantified by using asthma control test (ACT) scoring system. The correlation between IL-17F, mRNA, and level of asthma control was analyzed by using Pearson's correlation coefficient (r). Results. There is a strong positive correlation between IL-17F serum level and Nathan's ACT-score (r=0.969) which is statistically significant (p less than 0.001). Analysis of the correlation between mRNA IL-17F serum level and Nathan's ACT-score revealed a strong positive correlation (r=0.963), which is statistically significant (p less than 0.001). Conclusion. These findings suggest that IL-17F plays an important role in asthma control. However, the role played by IL-17F in asthma pathogenesis are still questions to be answered.";Respiratory system diseases;Observational;Study type out-of-domain;Test
519;30505484;A modified acute respiratory distress syndrome prediction score: a multicenter cohort study in China.;Background. Early recognition of the risks of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and prevention of the development of ARDS may be more effective in improving patient outcomes. We performed the present study to determine the ARDS risk factors in a Chinese population and validate a score to predict the development of ARDS. Methods. This was an observational multicenter cohort study performed in 13 tertiary hospitals in China. Patients admitted into participating intensive care units (ICUs) from January 1 to January 31, 2012, and from January 1 to January 10, 2013, were enrolled in a retrospective derivation cohort and a prospective validation cohort, respectively. In the derivation cohort, the potential risk factors of ARDS were collected. The confirmed risk factors were determined with univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses, and then the modified ARDS prediction score (MAPS) was established. We prospectively enrolled patients to verify the accuracy of MAPS. Results. A total of 479 and 198 patients were enrolled into the retrospective derivation cohort and the prospective validation cohort, respectively. A total of 93 (19.4%) patients developed ARDS in the derivation cohort. Acute pancreatitis, pneumonia, hypoalbuminemia, acidosis, and high respiratory rate were the risk factors for ARDS. The MAPS discriminated patients who developed ARDS from those who did not, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.809 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.758-0.859, P<0.001]. In the prospective validation cohort, performance of the MAPS was similar to the retrospective derivation cohort, with an AUC of 0.792 (95% CI, 0.717-0.867, P<0.001). The lung injury prediction score (LIPS) showed a predicted value of an AUC of 0.770 (95% CI, 0.728-0.812, P<0.001) in our patients, which was significantly lower than our score (P<0.046). Conclusions. The MAPS based on risk factors could help the clinician to predict patients who will develop ARDS. Trial registration.

520;31162201;Impact of Early Acute Kidney Injury on Management and Outcome in Patients With Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome: A Secondary Analysis of a Multicenter Observational Study.;"Objectives. To understand the impact of mild-moderate and severe acute kidney injury in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Design. Secondary analysis of the ""Large Observational Study to Understand the Global Impact of Severe Acute Respiratory Failure"", an international prospective cohort study of patients with severe respiratory failure. Setting. Four-hundred fifty-nine ICUs from 50 countries across five continents. Subjects. Patients with a glomerular filtration rate greater than 60 mL/min/1.73 m prior to admission who fulfilled criteria of acute respiratory distress syndrome on day 1 and day 2 of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Interventions. Patients were categorized based on worst serum creatinine or urine output into: 1) no acute kidney injury (serum creatinine < 132 µmol/L or urine output ≥ 0.5 mL/kg/hr), 2) mild-moderate acute kidney injury (serum creatinine 132-354 µmol/L or minimum urine output between 0.3 and 0.5mL/kg/hr), or 3) severe acute kidney injury (serum creatinine > 354 µmol/L or renal replacement therapy or minimum urine output < 0.3 mL/kg/hr). Measurements and main results. The primary outcome was hospital mortality, whereas secondary outcomes included prevalence of acute kidney injury and characterization of acute respiratory distress syndrome risk factors and illness severity patterns, in patients with acute kidney injury versus no acute kidney injury. One-thousand nine-hundred seventy-four patients met inclusion criteria: 1,209 (61%) with no acute kidney injury, 468 (24%) with mild-moderate acute kidney injury, and 297 (15%) with severe acute kidney injury. The impact of acute kidney injury on the ventilatory management of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome was relatively limited, with no differences in arterial CO2 tension or in tidal or minute ventilation between the groups. Hospital mortality increased from 31% in acute respiratory distress syndrome patients with no acute kidney injury to 50% in mild-moderate acute kidney injury (p ≤ 0.001 vs no acute kidney injury) and 58% in severe acute kidney injury (p ≤ 0.001 vs no acute kidney injury and mild-moderate acute kidney injury). In multivariate analyses, both mild-moderate (odds ratio, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.24-2.09; p < 0.001) and severe (odds ratio, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.55-2.94; p < 0.001) acute kidney injury were independently associated with mortality. Conclusions. The development of acute kidney injury, even when mild-moderate in severity, is associated with a substantial increase in mortality in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome.";Respiratory system diseases;Observational;Study type out-of-domain;Test
521;31553637;Cigarette smoke induces overexpression of active human cathepsin S in lungs from current smokers with or without COPD.;Cigarette smoking has marked effects on lung tissue, including induction of oxidative stress, inflammatory cell recruitment, and a protease/antiprotease imbalance. These effects contribute to tissue remodeling and destruction resulting in loss of lung function in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients. Cathepsin S (CatS) is a cysteine protease that is involved in the remodeling/degradation of connective tissue and basement membrane. Aberrant expression or activity of CatS has been implicated in a variety of diseases, including arthritis, cancer, cardiovascular, and lung diseases. However, little is known about the effect of cigarette smoking on both CatS expression and activity, as well as its role in smoking-related lung diseases. Here, we evaluated the expression and activity of human CatS in lung tissues from never-smokers and smokers with or without COPD. Despite the presence of an oxidizing environment, CatS expression and activity were significantly higher in current smokers (both non-COPD and COPD) compared with never-smokers, and correlated positively with smoking history. Moreover, we found that the exposure of primary human bronchial epithelial cells to cigarette smoke extract triggered the activation of P2X7 receptors, which in turns drives CatS upregulation. The present data suggest that excessive CatS expression and activity contribute, beside other proteases, to the deleterious effects of cigarette smoke on pulmonary homeostasis.;Respiratory system diseases;Observational;Study type out-of-domain;Test
522;31830919;Point-of-care ultrasound in Management for Dyspneic Uremic Patients: a case report.;Background. Point-of-Care Ultrasound (PoCUS) is considered as an extension of clinicians' patient care and can be integrated into daily clinical practice. Dyspnea is a common presentation in uremic patients. With the aids of PoCUS and integrated assessments of lung, heart and inferior vena cava (IVC), the etiology of dyspnea in uremic patients can be determined earlier. Case presentation. A 67-year-old woman presented with progressive shortness of breath and bilateral legs edema for 3 weeks. The laboratory data revealed marked elevated level of serum creatinine and blood urea. A large amount of pericardial effusion was timely detected by PoCUS. Uremic pericarditis was suspected. Emergent hemodialysis was initiated and her symptoms improved. Conclusions. PoCUS is a noninvasive and cost-effective imaging modality and it has been popular in the emergency department (ED). In uremic patients presenting with dyspnea, the integration of PoCUS into traditional physical examinations help emergency physicians narrow down the differential diagnoses.;Respiratory system diseases;Observational;Study type out-of-domain;Test
